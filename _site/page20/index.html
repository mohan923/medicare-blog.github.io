      <p>Did you notice something new today? Medicare.gov has a new design that makes it faster and easier for you to answer your Medicare questions.</p>
<p>We know Medicare.gov is your trusted source of online Medicare information.  That’s why we worked more than 2 years improving the things you use most. We did interviews and focus groups with people like you and the people who help you with your Medicare questions to help us find out what matters most to you. And, we used that feedback to make the website better.</p>
<p>The new Medicare.gov includes features not available before, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many ways for you to do the most common tasks, like finding out about costs, coverage, and plans, through several paths — right from the homepage</li>
<li>Action-oriented labels to help you get the information you want faster</li>
<li> Design that works on mobile devices, like tablets and smartphones, so you can get information anytime, anywhere, and in the most convenient format for you</li>
</ul>
<p>The new Medicare.gov is just one of our efforts over the past year to make it easier for you to understand your Medicare. Whether it’s putting our information in <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/04/16/lets-be-clear-plain-writing-works/">simple, straightforward language</a> so you can understand it the first time you read it or <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/04/12/cutting-the-clutter-the-newly-designed-medicare-summary-notice/">improving the design of the “Medicare Summary Notice ”</a> so you can better understand your Medicare claims,  we’re committed to making Medicare information clearer and simpler.</p>

      <p><span style="color:#000000;">You take your car for scheduled maintenance service just to make sure it’s fine, right? And, like most of us, you have things like car and homeowners insurance just in case you need it. Shouldn’t you take just as much precaution with yourself to make sure you stay healthy? Keeping your immune system strong is a lifelong, life-protecting job, but we’ve got you covered. Your Medicare </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/share-the-health/index.html">preventive benefits</a><span style="color:#000000;"> include 3 shots: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="color:#000000;">      </span></strong><a title="Click here to view Flu Shots" href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/flu-shots.aspx"><strong>Flu Shots</strong></a><span style="color:#000000;">—Covered once a flu season in the fall or winter. <strong></strong></span></li>
<li><strong>      </strong><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/hepititis-b-shots.aspx"><strong>Hepatitis B Shots</strong></a><strong>—</strong><span style="color:#000000;">Covered for people at high or medium risk for Hepatitis B (usually a series of 3 shots).<strong></strong></span></li>
<li><strong>      </strong><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/pneumococcal-shot.aspx"><strong>Pneumococcal Shot</strong></a><strong>—</strong><span style="color:#000000;">Covered to help prevent pneumococcal infections (like certain types of pneumonia). Most people only need this shot once in their lifetime. <strong></strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Getting your shots has never been easier. As we approach the fall season, you’ll see these shots offered in many places, such as your local pharmacy, so make sure you take advantage of them. As long as the supplier or doctor accepts </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Glossary/a.html#assignment">assignment</a><span style="color:#000000;"> for giving the shot, you pay nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">You’re way more important than your car or house so make the time to stay healthy.</span></p>

      <p><span style="color:#000000;">Even when it’s a labor of love, caring for an aged, seriously ill or disabled friend or family member can be hard, and you may wonder whether anybody can understand what you’re going through. Actually, <em>many</em> people can relate to your situation—did you know nearly 66 million Americans serve as caregivers? It’s difficult to wrap your mind around a number that large, which is why we created </span><a href="http://medicare.gov/caregivers/community-stories.html">Caregiver Stories</a><span style="color:#000000;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Meet </span><a href="http://medicare.gov/caregivers/stories-james-patterson.html">James Patterson</a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">. </span>James became a caregiver to his wife on New Year’s Day 2005, after she was hospitalized with complications from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As with many others in his situation, he didn’t just wake up that day and choose to become a caregiver. “It's a very long process, becoming a caregiver, and you never realize you've begun until you have a chance to reflect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">According to James, being a caregiver is a big responsibility, one that can be isolating. “I think men, in particular, tend to think they can handle everything themselves and are not as comfortable asking for help,” he says. “That's a mistake—it's important to get help when you need it and have support structures in place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">James suggests that caregivers take some time for themselves when and if they can. Two or 3 times a week, he has a caregiving helper come and stay with his wife for a few hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“These breaks are extremely important because I can get chores or errands done or go play a game of golf,” he explains. “As a caregiver, you can never really get away—you're always there. But, if you can find time for something else and get away from your daily routine even for a short while, it can be very rejuvenating.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Although the physical demands are great, he also notes the emotional weight that many caregivers carry. “A struggle I deal with as a caregiver is that you don't always get a ‘thank you’ for your hard work because it becomes expected and part of the routine, which can sometimes make you frustrated or angry. However, my actions are just part of our way of our life, so ‘thank-yous’ aren't needed or expected anymore, and when one comes along, it's a really big deal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">His “best advice” for new caregivers: “Be patient and be in it for the long haul. Get as much information as possible and know that people are there to support you.” James describes the resources at </span><a href="http://medicare.gov/caregivers/index.html">Ask Medicare</a><span style="color:#000000;"> and the </span><a href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/">National Institute on Aging</a><span style="color:#000000;"> as invaluable. “They cover everything from bathing to hygiene to incontinence. I'm learning something new every day. I can show the materials available to my wife and we can read them together so she can help me help her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">If James’ story inspired you or gave you food for thought about your caregiver experience, then please consider sharing <em>your</em> best tips and lessons. Write about your experience and send a photo to </span><a href="mailto:caregiverstories@cms.hhs.gov"><strong>caregiverstories@cms.hhs.gov</strong></a><span style="color:#000000;">–we may add your story to our website!</span></p>
