      <p>Do you make resolutions for the new year? Here are some easy ones you can keep that will help get you ready for 2015:</p>
<p><strong>1. Check to see that you have the right insurance card to use when you go to the doctor in 2015.</strong> Did you change your health or drug plan during Medicare Open Enrollment? If you did and you haven’t received your new card or welcome packet by January 1<sup>st</sup>, contact your plan for help. If you need to fill a prescription right away, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/coverage/filling-prescription-without-card/fill-prescriptions-without-card.html">find out how to fill a prescription without your card</a>.</p>
<p>If you changed from a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) back to Original Medicare, use your red, white, and blue Medicare card when you go to the doctor. <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/medicarecard/">Get a new card if you lost or damaged yours, or need to update your information</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Budget for next year’s Medicare Part B deductible.</strong></p>
<p>Remember, if you have Medicare Part B and you’re in Original Medicare, you’ll have to meet your deductible before your Medicare coverage pays for services and supplies. Next year, the Medicare Part B deductible will be $147, the same as it was in 2014. Plan your health care budget to account for the increased cost of doctor visits for the time that it will take to cover your deductible. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/costs-at-a-glance/costs-at-glance.html">Find out more about Medicare costs in 2015.</a></p>
<p><strong>3.  Schedule appointments to get any preventive tests or screenings.</strong></p>
<p>Medicare covers all sorts of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive services</a> to keep you healthy and screenings to check for health problems, and many are covered each year at no cost to you. Ask your doctor when you should schedule your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">wellness visit</a> and other screenings. You can also use <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">MyMedicare.gov</a> to track your visits and make a calendar of preventive services.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about these covered preventive services to find out what’s right for your health needs.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Make sure your drug or health plan meet your needs.</strong></p>
<p>If not, Medicare has a way for you to get the coverage you want instead of having to wait for the next Open Enrollment. At any time during the year, you can switch to a Medicare Advantage Plan or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan that has a 5-star rating.</p>
<p>Plan ratings are based on member surveys, information from doctors and health care providers, and other sources. The plan ratings are scores that show the quality and performance of the plan, on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 being the highest rated plans.</p>
<p>You can make this change once per calendar year. <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Find 5-star health and drug plans in your area</a>.</p>
<p>Remember to check <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/">www.medicare.gov</a> for the latest Medicare news and information, and have a happy and healthy new year!</p>

      <p>“To do” lists are very helpful during this hectic time of year. If something important isn’t written down, it’s easy to forget. If you still haven’t crossed off “Compare Medicare coverage” from your to do list, time is running out!</p>
<p>Medicare Open Enrollment ends this week on December 7. To help you sort through your choices, try using the <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a>. You can review the plan options in your area and decide the best mix of benefits and costs that meets your needs and budget.</p>
<p>In these last few days of Medicare Open Enrollment, take a moment to review your health care coverage and see if you need to make any changes for next year. If you decide you’re happy with the plan you have now, and the plan’s still being offered next year, you don’t need to do anything. But if you’re thinking about making any changes, now’s the time to act so you can cross another item off your to do list.</p>

      <p>Did you know that every year 50,000 people are diagnosed with HIV? Of the 1.1 million people living with HIV in the United States, 1 in every 6 doesn’t even know they have it. December 1<sup>st</sup> 2014 is World AIDS day and the theme is “Focus, Partner, Achieve: An AIDS-free Generation.”</p>
<p>HIV is the virus that can lead to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. Early testing and diagnosis play key roles in reducing the spread of the disease, extending life expectancy, and cutting costs of care. At least 1 in 3 people in the U.S. who test positive for HIV is tested too late to get the full advantage of treatment. Testing is also an important first step in getting HIV-infected people the medical care and support they need to improve their health and help them maintain safer behaviors.</p>
<p>What can you do to help achieve an AIDS-free generation? Medicare covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hiv-screening.html">HIV screening</a> for people with Medicare of any age who ask for the test, pregnant women, and people at increased risk for the infection (like gay and bisexual men, injection drug users, or people with multiple sexual partners).</p>
<p>Visit Aids.gov to learn more about <a href="http://aids.gov/news-and-events/awareness-days/world-aids-day/">World AIDS Day</a> and CDC.gov to learn more about their <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ActAgainstAIDS/">Act Against AIDS campaign</a>.</p>
<p>To find an HIV test site, visit HIVtest.cdc.gov or text your zip code to “KNOWIT” (566948).</p>

      <p>We like when things are automatic. From smart phone reminders to automatic coffee makers – it’s nice when something’s done before we even need to think about doing it. Whether you’ve already picked a new plan for 2015, or decided to keep the plan you had in 2014, one thing you might not have thought about is paying the monthly premium.</p>
<p>Most Medicare drug plans charge a monthly premium that varies by plan. You pay this in addition to your Medicare Part B premium. It’s important to pay this premium on time to keep your coverage and the peace of mind that comes with it.</p>
<p>Did you know that you can have this premium automatically deducted from your monthly Social Security payment? All you need to do is contact your Medicare drug plan (not Social Security). Your first deduction will usually take 3 months to start, and 3 months of premiums will likely be deducted at once. After that, only one premium will be deducted each month. You may also see a delay in premiums being withheld if you switch plans. If you want to stop premium deductions and get billed directly, just let your plan know.</p>
<p>Take the worry and guesswork out of when to pay your premium bills - contact your plan today.</p>
