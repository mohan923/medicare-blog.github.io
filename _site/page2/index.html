      <p>“To do” lists are very helpful during this hectic time of year. If something important isn’t written down, it’s easy to forget. If you still haven’t crossed off “Compare Medicare coverage” from your to do list, time is running out!</p>
<p>Medicare Open Enrollment ends this week on December 7. To help you sort through your choices, try using the <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a>. You can review the plan options in your area and decide the best mix of benefits and costs that meets your needs and budget.</p>
<p>In these last few days of Medicare Open Enrollment, take a moment to review your health care coverage and see if you need to make any changes for next year. If you decide you’re happy with the plan you have now, and the plan’s still being offered next year, you don’t need to do anything. But if you’re thinking about making any changes, now’s the time to act so you can cross another item off your to do list.</p>

      <p>Did you know that every year 50,000 people are diagnosed with HIV? Of the 1.1 million people living with HIV in the United States, 1 in every 6 doesn’t even know they have it. December 1<sup>st</sup> 2014 is World AIDS day and the theme is “Focus, Partner, Achieve: An AIDS-free Generation.”</p>
<p>HIV is the virus that can lead to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. Early testing and diagnosis play key roles in reducing the spread of the disease, extending life expectancy, and cutting costs of care. At least 1 in 3 people in the U.S. who test positive for HIV is tested too late to get the full advantage of treatment. Testing is also an important first step in getting HIV-infected people the medical care and support they need to improve their health and help them maintain safer behaviors.</p>
<p>What can you do to help achieve an AIDS-free generation? Medicare covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hiv-screening.html">HIV screening</a> for people with Medicare of any age who ask for the test, pregnant women, and people at increased risk for the infection (like gay and bisexual men, injection drug users, or people with multiple sexual partners).</p>
<p>Visit Aids.gov to learn more about <a href="http://aids.gov/news-and-events/awareness-days/world-aids-day/">World AIDS Day</a> and CDC.gov to learn more about their <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ActAgainstAIDS/">Act Against AIDS campaign</a>.</p>
<p>To find an HIV test site, visit HIVtest.cdc.gov or text your zip code to “KNOWIT” (566948).</p>

      <p>We like when things are automatic. From smart phone reminders to automatic coffee makers – it’s nice when something’s done before we even need to think about doing it. Whether you’ve already picked a new plan for 2015, or decided to keep the plan you had in 2014, one thing you might not have thought about is paying the monthly premium.</p>
<p>Most Medicare drug plans charge a monthly premium that varies by plan. You pay this in addition to your Medicare Part B premium. It’s important to pay this premium on time to keep your coverage and the peace of mind that comes with it.</p>
<p>Did you know that you can have this premium automatically deducted from your monthly Social Security payment? All you need to do is contact your Medicare drug plan (not Social Security). Your first deduction will usually take 3 months to start, and 3 months of premiums will likely be deducted at once. After that, only one premium will be deducted each month. You may also see a delay in premiums being withheld if you switch plans. If you want to stop premium deductions and get billed directly, just let your plan know.</p>
<p>Take the worry and guesswork out of when to pay your premium bills - contact your plan today.</p>

      <p>Have you ever found yourself skipping a day of your medication or cutting your pills in half to make your supply last a little longer? Or, have you put off filling a prescription because you’re having trouble making ends meet? If so, we can help. Medicare has a special program called “<a href="http://medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/save-on-drug-costs/save-on-drug-costs.html">Extra Help</a>.” If you have limited income and resources, you can sign up to get help paying things like your monthly premium, annual deductible, and prescription copayments in your Medicare drug plan. In 2015, drug costs for most people who qualify will be no more than $2.65 for each generic drug and $6.60 for each brand-name drug.</p>
<p>Even if you’re not sure you’d qualify, it’s worth filling out an application to see. Many people with Medicare may be eligible for the Extra Help program but don’t even know it. Are you or a family member one of them?</p>
<p>It’s easy and free to apply for Extra Help. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/extrahelp">online</a>.</li>
<li>Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213. TTY users should call 1‑800‑325‑0778.</li>
<li>Apply at your <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/apps6z/FOLO/fo001.jsp">local Social Security office</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t wait - apply today to see if you qualify for some extra help with your health costs.</p>
