    <article class="post-content">
      <p>As we enter flu season, you may seek fast relief when illness strikes, but think twice before asking your doctor for antibiotics. Did you know that <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/know-and-do.html">if you have a cold or flu, antibiotics won’t work for you?</a> That’s because antibiotics cure bacterial infections, not viral infections. Every time someone takes antibiotics, sensitive bacteria are killed, but resistant germs may survive to grow and multiply. These resistant germs lead to severe infections, hospitalizations, and death - especially among people over 65.</p>
<p>The CDC has marked this week as <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/index.html">Get Smart About Antibiotics Week</a>. Here are 3 things you can do to make sure you're using antibiotics properly:</p>
<p>1. Take antibiotics only to treat a true bacterial infection. It should be for only as long as your doctor prescribed to treat the infection, to reduce your risk of getting the infection again, or to reduce the risk to those around you.</p>
<p>2. Always talk to your doctor before taking an antibiotic to be sure it will treat the infection you have.</p>
<p>3. Never take antibiotics for a <i>viral</i> infection, such as a cold, cough, or the flu. Antibiotics won’t cure your virus, they won’t keep those around you from getting the illness, and they won’t help you feel better. In fact, taking antibiotics when you have a virus may do you more harm than good, because you increase your risk of getting an antibiotic-resistant infection later.</p>
<p>Antibiotics won’t help you recover from the flu, but keep yourself from catching the major flu viruses in the first place by getting your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/flu-shots.html">flu shot</a>! It’s free for people with Medicare, once per flu season in the fall or winter, when given by doctors or other health care providers (such as senior centers and pharmacies) that take Medicare.</p>

      <ol>
<li>Guard your information.</li>
<li>Be wary of giveaways.</li>
<li>Don’t lend your identity.</li>
<li>If you spot something, say something.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are 4 simple ways to protect your identity and personal information from Medicare fraud, but they can be difficult to do if you’re caught off guard.</p>
<p>During Medicare Open Enrollment - between now and December 7 - you can expect to hear a lot about Medicare. You might be hearing a lot about the Health Insurance Marketplace this fall. That’s because the <b>Marketplace</b> Open Enrollment period overlaps with the <b>Medicare</b> Open Enrollment period.</p>
<p>The Marketplace is designed to help people who don’t have any health coverage. If you have health coverage through Medicare,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/medicare-and-the-marketplace.html"> the Marketplace won’t have any effect on your Medicare coverage</a>. In fact,<b> it’s against the law for someone who knows that you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan</b>.</p>
<p>Open Enrollment is a great time for you to review and compare your Medicare choices and make sure you have the coverage that fits your needs. Unfortunately, it’s also a popular time for Medicare fraud schemes.</p>
<p>Here are a few reminders to keep you safe from those who might not have your best interests in mind:</p>
<p><b>1.     </b><b>Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers – treat them like you’d treat your credit cards.</b></p>
<p>You’ll be hearing so much about Medicare during Open Enrollment, that it may not surprise you to get phone calls or visits to your house from people selling Medicare plans.</p>
<p>It’s illegal for someone to call and ask for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information.  A Medicare representative or a private insurance plan working with Medicare will <b>never</b> call and ask for this information, and we will <b>never</b> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.   And remember, it’s against the law for someone who knows that you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan.</p>
<p>2. <b>Be suspicious of people offering free medical equipment or services.</b></p>
<p>Anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number is tricking you – if it’s really free, they don’t need your Medicare number. It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!</p>
<p><b>3.     </b><b>Don’t let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare card or your personal information.</b></p>
<p>If someone asks you for your Medicare number, stop and think. If you wouldn’t feel comfortable giving that person your credit card number, <b>don’t</b> give them your Medicare number.</p>
<p>4. <b>Most importantly, if you suspect Medicare fraud, let us know!</b> Call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227).</p>
<p>Learn more at <a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/xa55/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/M95LQ2NH/stopmedicarefraud.gov">stopmedicarefraud.gov</a>. Remember, a little preparation goes a long way. If you experience a Medicare fraud scheme - walk away, hang up, close the door, or say “no thanks.”</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>Have you ever pumped gas into your car from a station just around the corner from home even though it’s a bit more expensive than the one in town? Most of us have made decisions to do or not do something based on convenience.</p>
<p>The same is true when it comes to choosing a health plan: convenience matters. So in addition to cost, coverage, and benefits, here are some other things you may want to consider as you compare Medicare options this year:</p>
<p><b>Doctor and hospital choice</b></p>
<p>You want to be comfortable with the people you’re working with, especially when it comes to something as private as your health. Do the doctors you know accept your coverage? Where are the doctors’ offices? What are their hours? Do they often keep you waiting?</p>
<p><b>Pharmacy access</b></p>
<p>Is the pharmacy you use included in your drug plan’s network?  Do they use <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-prescribing/electronic-prescribing.html">e-prescribing</a>? Can you get refills by mail? Remember that plan networks can change from year to year. If it’s important to you to stay with the same pharmacy, it’s worth checking to make sure they’ll still be in your plan’s network.</p>
<p><b>Travel</b></p>
<p>Maybe you travel a lot, or spend part of the year in a different state. If you do, make sure you know whether your coverage will travel with you.</p>
<p><b>Quality</b></p>
<p>Ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/when-can-i-join-a-health-or-drug-plan/five-star-enrollment/5-star-enrollment-period.html">Look for plans with a 5‑star performance</a> rating — the right expertise and care may help speed your recovery and improve your outcomes.</p>
<p>Your time is valuable — and so is your health. Only you know what mix of coverage and convenience is most important to you and your family.</p>
<p>We’re working hard to make sure you have choices in the way you get the Medicare benefits you’ve earned – and we want you to be comfortable. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>November 2013 marks the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Medicare coverage for Hospice care. That’s right, for 30 years Medicare has covered hospice care, so that those who are terminally ill can spend the last moments of their lives with dignity and comfort, among their loved ones.</p>
<p>Hospice is a program of care and support for people who are terminally ill. The focus is on comfort and support, not on curing an illness. Hospice care is generally provided in the home, by a specially trained team of professionals and caregivers. Services may include physical care, counseling, drugs, equipment, and supplies for the terminal illness and related condition(s).</p>
<p>For more information about hospice, you can visit Medicare.gov. To find a hospice program, talk to your doctor or call your <a href="http://medicare.gov/contacts/">state hospice organization</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s to 30 more years of providing the comfort, care, and support that you and your family deserve during this difficult time.</p>
