      <p>It feels like “to do” lists are everywhere these days – on a pad of paper on the kitchen table, in email, or in an app on a smart phone.  If you still have “Review Medicare coverage” on your to do list, time is running out!</p>
<p>Medicare Open Enrollment ends this week on December 7. To help you sort through your choices, try using the <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a>. You can review the plan options in your area and decide the best mix of benefits and costs that meets your needs and budget.</p>
<p>Remember, the <b>Marketplace</b> Open Enrollment period overlaps with the <b>Medicare</b> Open Enrollment period. The Marketplace is designed to help people who don’t have any health coverage. If you have health coverage through Medicare,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/medicare-and-the-marketplace.html"> the Marketplace won’t have any effect on your Medicare coverage</a>.</p>
<p>In these last few days of Medicare Open Enrollment, take a second to review your options.  If you like your current health care coverage, you don’t need to do anything. But if you’re thinking about making any changes, now’s the time to act and cross another item off your to do list.</p>

      <p>If you’ve ever found yourself skipping a day of your medication or cutting your pills in half to make your supply last a little longer, there’s help. Medicare has a special program called “<a href="http://medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/save-on-drug-costs/save-on-drug-costs.html">Extra Help</a>.” If you have limited income and resources you can sign up to get help paying things like monthly premiums, annual deductibles, and prescription copayments in your Medicare drug plan.  Even if you’re not sure you’d qualify, it’s worth filling out an application to see.</p>
<p>Many people with Medicare may be eligible for the Extra Help program but don’t even know it. Are you or a family member one of them?</p>
<p>It’s easy and free to apply for Extra Help. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/extrahelp">online</a>.</li>
<li>Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213. TTY users should call 1‑800‑325‑0778.</li>
<li>Apply at your <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/apps6z/FOLO/fo001.jsp">local Social Security office</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t wait - apply today to see if you qualify for some extra help with your health costs.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>As we enter flu season, you may seek fast relief when illness strikes, but think twice before asking your doctor for antibiotics. Did you know that <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/know-and-do.html">if you have a cold or flu, antibiotics won’t work for you?</a> That’s because antibiotics cure bacterial infections, not viral infections. Every time someone takes antibiotics, sensitive bacteria are killed, but resistant germs may survive to grow and multiply. These resistant germs lead to severe infections, hospitalizations, and death - especially among people over 65.</p>
<p>The CDC has marked this week as <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/index.html">Get Smart About Antibiotics Week</a>. Here are 3 things you can do to make sure you're using antibiotics properly:</p>
<p>1. Take antibiotics only to treat a true bacterial infection. It should be for only as long as your doctor prescribed to treat the infection, to reduce your risk of getting the infection again, or to reduce the risk to those around you.</p>
<p>2. Always talk to your doctor before taking an antibiotic to be sure it will treat the infection you have.</p>
<p>3. Never take antibiotics for a <i>viral</i> infection, such as a cold, cough, or the flu. Antibiotics won’t cure your virus, they won’t keep those around you from getting the illness, and they won’t help you feel better. In fact, taking antibiotics when you have a virus may do you more harm than good, because you increase your risk of getting an antibiotic-resistant infection later.</p>
<p>Antibiotics won’t help you recover from the flu, but keep yourself from catching the major flu viruses in the first place by getting your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/flu-shots.html">flu shot</a>! It’s free for people with Medicare, once per flu season in the fall or winter, when given by doctors or other health care providers (such as senior centers and pharmacies) that take Medicare.</p>

      <ol>
<li>Guard your information.</li>
<li>Be wary of giveaways.</li>
<li>Don’t lend your identity.</li>
<li>If you spot something, say something.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are 4 simple ways to protect your identity and personal information from Medicare fraud, but they can be difficult to do if you’re caught off guard.</p>
<p>During Medicare Open Enrollment - between now and December 7 - you can expect to hear a lot about Medicare. You might be hearing a lot about the Health Insurance Marketplace this fall. That’s because the <b>Marketplace</b> Open Enrollment period overlaps with the <b>Medicare</b> Open Enrollment period.</p>
<p>The Marketplace is designed to help people who don’t have any health coverage. If you have health coverage through Medicare,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/medicare-and-the-marketplace.html"> the Marketplace won’t have any effect on your Medicare coverage</a>. In fact,<b> it’s against the law for someone who knows that you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan</b>.</p>
<p>Open Enrollment is a great time for you to review and compare your Medicare choices and make sure you have the coverage that fits your needs. Unfortunately, it’s also a popular time for Medicare fraud schemes.</p>
<p>Here are a few reminders to keep you safe from those who might not have your best interests in mind:</p>
<p><b>1.     </b><b>Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers – treat them like you’d treat your credit cards.</b></p>
<p>You’ll be hearing so much about Medicare during Open Enrollment, that it may not surprise you to get phone calls or visits to your house from people selling Medicare plans.</p>
<p>It’s illegal for someone to call and ask for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information.  A Medicare representative or a private insurance plan working with Medicare will <b>never</b> call and ask for this information, and we will <b>never</b> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.   And remember, it’s against the law for someone who knows that you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan.</p>
<p>2. <b>Be suspicious of people offering free medical equipment or services.</b></p>
<p>Anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number is tricking you – if it’s really free, they don’t need your Medicare number. It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!</p>
<p><b>3.     </b><b>Don’t let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare card or your personal information.</b></p>
<p>If someone asks you for your Medicare number, stop and think. If you wouldn’t feel comfortable giving that person your credit card number, <b>don’t</b> give them your Medicare number.</p>
<p>4. <b>Most importantly, if you suspect Medicare fraud, let us know!</b> Call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227).</p>
<p>Learn more at <a href="/Documents%20and%20Settings/xa55/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/M95LQ2NH/stopmedicarefraud.gov">stopmedicarefraud.gov</a>. Remember, a little preparation goes a long way. If you experience a Medicare fraud scheme - walk away, hang up, close the door, or say “no thanks.”</p>
