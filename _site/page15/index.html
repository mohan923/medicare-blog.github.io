      <p>Medicare fraud affects everyone. You can team up with Medicare to help.</p>
<p>Our Senior Medicare Patrol volunteers are teaching people like you how to spot, report, and stop fraud, and protect themselves from identity theft.</p>
<p>Here are some things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers. <strong>Treat them like you would treat your credit cards</strong>.</li>
<li>Hang up the phone if someone calls and asks for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information. We will <strong>NEVER</strong> call and ask for this information, and we will <strong>NEVER</strong> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.</li>
<li>Be suspicious of anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number. <strong>It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!</strong></li>
<li>Do not let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare ID card or your identity.</li>
<li>Check your Medicare claims for errors. Look at your Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) or statements from your Medicare plan. You can also check <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">www.MyMedicare.gov </a>or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) as soon as your claims have been processed. The sooner you see and report errors, the sooner we can stop fraud. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.</li>
<li>Call 1-800-MEDICARE to report any suspected fraud.</li>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><em>By Jonathan Blum, Acting Principal Deputy Administrator and Director, Center for Medicare</em><i> </i></p>
<p>In the past few days, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) announced four critical initiatives that are designed to enhance health care delivery for millions of Medicare beneficiaries by improving care or lowering costs, or both.  Taken together the announcements illustrate the breadth and diversity of efforts underway to ensure a better, stronger, more patient-centered Medicare program.</p>
<p>Last week, we announced a new health care delivery system reform, made possible by the Affordable Care Act, to test how bundling of payments for episodes of care, for example a heart attack or stroke, instead of paying for each test or procedure or physician’s visit, can result in more coordinated, higher quality care for beneficiaries.  By bundling payments for services that beneficiaries receive during an episode of care, CMS hopes to encourage doctors, hospitals, and others  to work together to improve care and health outcomes, while also lowering Medicare costs.  Over 500 organizations, nationwide, have already signed-on to participate.</p>
<p>We also announced a major expansion of the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) Competitive Bidding Program.  In its first year of operation, competitive bidding, where prices are based on suppliers’ bids, saved the Medicare program, and taxpayers, over $202 million, while maintaining access to quality products for Medicare beneficiaries in the nine areas of the country where the program launched.   It’s a great example of the Administration’s determination to put the brakes on runaway healthcare costs.  With this expansion in the program, Medicare beneficiaries in 91 major metropolitan areas will save an average of 45 percent on certain DMEPOS items beginning in July.  Between 2013 and 2022, we estimate that the expansion of the DMEPOS program will save Medicare $25.7 billion, while saving beneficiaries, who pay a percentage for medical equipment and supplies, $17.1 billion through lower prices.</p>
<p>This week, we issued a proposed rule which will help health care providers and hospitals to operate more efficiently by getting rid of regulations that are outdated, obsolete, or excessively burdensome.  Many of the rule’s provisions streamline requirements that health care providers must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, without jeopardizing patient safety, and they will save providers nearly $676 million annually.  Just as important, by eliminating burdensome requirements, health care providers can improve the quality of health care delivery for Medicare beneficiaries by spending more time focusing on patient care and less time filling out forms.</p>
<p>Finally this week, we announced the Comprehensive End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Care Initiative.  It will help identify, test and evaluate new ways to improve care for Medicare beneficiaries living with ESRD.  We’ll be working with the health care provider community to care for a population that significant and complex health care needs.  Through better care coordination, beneficiaries can more easily navigate the multiple providers involved in their care, ultimately improving their health outcomes.</p>
<p>These four initiatives demonstrate that CMS is employing new and novel tools and programs, thinking outside the box and beyond the usual way of doing things, in order to improve health care delivery for people with Medicare and, in the process, strengthen the Medicare program for current and future beneficiaries.</p>

      <p><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000;">Although popular love songs might tell you otherwise, a broken heart can’t kill you – but </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#800080;">heart disease</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"> can.  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">You might not be able to avoid Cupid’s arrow, but you can take steps to lower your risks and prevent heart disease.  Start by scheduling an appointment with your doctor to discuss whether you’re at risk for heart disease.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000;">Medicare will cover a </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/cardiovascular-screening.aspx"><span style="font-family:Arial;">cardiovascular screening</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"> at no cost to you every 5 years.  The screening includes tests to help detect heart disease early and measures cholesterol, blood fat (lipids), and triglyceride levels.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">If you and your doctor discover that you’re at risk for a heart attack or stroke, there are steps you can take to help prevent these conditions.  </span></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">You might be able to make lifestyle changes (like changing your diet and increasing your activity level or exercising more often) to lower your cholesterol and stay healthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000;">Luckily, you don’t have to face these challenges alone. The national </span><a href="http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Million Hearts</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"> campaign</span> <span style="font-family:Arial;">has pledged to help prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes over the next 5 years. You can join them, and get information and resources you need to learn how to take care of your heart and live a healthy life.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000;">February is </span><a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#800080;">American Heart Month</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">, and a healthy heart is the best Valentine’s Day gift you could ever give yourself, or the people who love you.  </span></span></p>

<p>It’s the New Year, which means it’s time for those annual resolutions, whether it’s eating right or tackling a new skill.  But none may be more important than making the resolution to get heart healthy in 2013.</p>
<p>Did you know heart attacks and strokes are the first and fourth leading cause of death in the U.S.? The <a href="http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/">Million Hearts™ initiative</a>, launched in 2012, is aiming to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. CMS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working with other federal agencies, communities, health systems, non-profit organizations and private-sector partners to help educate Americans on how to make a long-lasting impact against cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>If you’re at risk for, or are already suffering from, heart disease, now’s the time to practice the “Million Hearts ABCS”:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>A</b>spirin for people at risk</li>
<li><b>B</b>lood pressure control</li>
<li><b>C</b>holesterol management and</li>
<li><b>S</b>moking cessation</li>
</ul>
<p>Medicare can help you take control of many of the major risk factors for heart disease. People with Medicare can get <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cardiovascular-disease-screenings.html">cardiovascular screenings</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/smoking-and-tobacco-use-cessation.html">counseling to stop smoking</a>, and blood pressure and weight checks during their <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly wellness visit</a> with their doctor.</p>
<p>Make a New Year’s resolution and give your loved ones one more gift they’ll be sure to treasure—a healthier you in 2013. Help prevent a heart attack or stroke by <a href="http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/be_one_mh.html">joining the Million Hearts</a>™ initiative.</p>
