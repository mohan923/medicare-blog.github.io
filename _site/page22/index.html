      <p><em>Written By: Ingrid Donato, Mental Health Promotion Branch Chief, Center for Mental Health Services. Crosspost from <a href="http://blog.samhsa.gov/2012/06/27/how-we-can-stop-older-americans-from-being-bullied/">SAMHSA Blog</a>.</em></p>
<p>Bullying-like aggression can happen to people of all ages – including older Americans. One has to look no further than the situation of Karen Klein, the 68-year-old monitor of Bus 784 in Greece, NY who was tormented by adolescents in a school bus.</p>
<p>Although bullying is typically defined as occurring among youth, what happened on this bus shows that this type of aggression can happen to anyone.  For older adults these problems can occur in many settings, including their homes and long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes or assisted living residencesllying can come at the hands of many people in direct contact with elders, including caregivers, family, or even facility residents.</p>
<p>One of the most painful forms of bullying is isolation.</p>
<p>As hard as it is to spot, and sometimes accept, offenders may include family members and old friends, newly developed “friends” who intentionally prey on older adults, and service providers in positions of trust.</p>
<p>While there is no typical profile of an abuser, the following are some behavioral signs that may indicate problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abusing alcohol or other drugs</li>
<li>Controlling elder’s actions: whom they see and talk to, where they go</li>
<li>Isolating elders from family and friends, which can increase dependence</li>
<li>Emotional/ financial dependency on elder; inability to be self‐sufficient</li>
<li>Threatening to leave or send elder to a nursing home</li>
<li>Appearing to be indifferent to the child or elder; seeming apathetic or hostile</li>
<li>Minimizing an elder’s injuries, blaming victim or others for the abuse, neglect, or exploitation</li>
<li>Threatening to harm a victim’s pet</li>
<li>Calling the elder and or young person names</li>
<li>Previous criminal history</li>
<li>Longstanding personality traits (bad temper, hypercritical, tendency to blame others for problems)</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking time to <a href="http://store.samhsa.gov/product/15-Make-Time-To-Listen-Take-Time-To-Talk-About-Bullying/SMA08-4321">listen</a> and to really “hear” people–of any age—are the first lines of defense against <a href="http://www.stopbullying.gov/what-is-bullying/index.html">bullying</a>.  Looking for these signs and carefully talking with the older people in your life can be an important first step in determining whether or not there is a problem.  If you know someone who is being bullied or is a victim of aggressive behavior, there are steps you can take to get the bullying to stop – and the information is available at: <a href="http://www.stopbullying.gov/what-is-bullying/related-topics/young-adults/index.html">http://www.stopbullying.gov/what-is-bullying/related-topics/young-adults/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>If you suspect elder abuse, neglect, or exploitation, visit the <a href="http://www.ncea.aoa.gov/NCEAroot/Main_Site/Find_Help/State_Resources.aspx">National Center on Elder Abuse</a> to find phone numbers for your state, or call the Eldercare Locator at <strong>1-800-677-1116.</strong>  If someone is in immediate danger, <strong>call 911 or the local police</strong>.</p>
<p>Through communication and action, older Americans and people of all ages can free themselves of the risks, torment and trauma of events like what happened on Bus 784.</p>

      <p><span style="color:#000000;">Did you know that more than 1 million Americans are living with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection, yet approximately 1 in 5 of them don't know it?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Have you been tested? Medicare covers </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/hiv-screening.aspx">HIV screening</a><span style="color:#000000;"> once every 12 months, or up to 3 times during a pregnancy, for people with Medicare of any age who ask for the test, pregnant women, and people at increased risk for the infection (such as gay and bisexual men, injection drug users, or people with multiple sexual partners). You pay nothing for the tests, but you generally have to pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for the doctor visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Early testing and diagnosis is key to prevention. At least 1 in 3 people in the U.S. who test positive for HIV is tested too late to get the full advantage of treatment. Early testing cuts the spread of disease, extends life expectancy, and cuts costs of care. Testing is an important first step in bringing people with HIV infection the medical care and support they need to improve their health and help them maintain safer behaviors.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">June 27 is National HIV Testing Day. Make sure your loved ones have been tested—the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 be tested for HIV at least once in their lifetime. You can learn more about HIV testing and what you can do to increase testing awareness by visiting the </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Features/HIVtesting/">Centers for Disease Control</a><span style="color:#000000;">.</span></p>

      <p>Do you or a loved one have cataracts?  A cataract is a clouding of the eye’s lens that affects vision. According to the National Eye Institute, by age 80, more than half of all Americans will either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery.</p>
<p>Medicare can help. Medicare Part B covers cataract surgery, and after surgery Medicare helps pay for cataract glasses, contact lenses, or intraocular lenses you get from an ophthalmologist.</p>
<p>Cataracts often come with age—they affect the vision of about half of all people between 65 and 74. Your risk for cataracts also may increase through long term exposure to sunlight, if you have diabetes, or if you smoke. New eyeglasses, brighter lighting, anti-glare sunglasses, or magnifying lenses may help your symptoms. If not, you may need surgery to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial lens.</p>
<p>June is Cataract Awareness Month. Visit the <a href="http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/cataract/">National Eye Institute</a> at the National Institutes of Health to learn more about cataracts.</p>

      <p>Are you or a loved one hooked on tobacco? Join the millions who’ve found a good reason to give it up—tobacco use is the second leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for 1 in every 10 adult deaths.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to quit, we can help. Part B covers free counseling sessions as a preventive service to help you <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/smoking-cessation.aspx">quit smoking</a>—you pay nothing if your doctor accepts Medicare’s payment.</p>
<p>If you’ve already been diagnosed with an illness caused or made worse by tobacco use or you take a medicine affected by tobacco, you can continue to get up to 8 face-to-face counseling visits every 12 months. You pay your Part B deductible, and 20% of the Medicare-approved amount. If you get counseling in a hospital outpatient setting, you also pay the hospital a copayment.</p>
<p>Make May 31—World “No Tobacco” Day—your starting point to kick the habit. Visit the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/">Centers for Disease Control</a> and the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/tobacco/smoking">National Cancer Institute</a> to learn more about tobacco use and how you can overcome it.</p>

<p><strong>By: Lawrence R. Deyton, M.S.P.H., M.D. </strong>Crosspost from <a href="http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2012/05/national-womens-health-week-the-dangers-of-using-tobacco-products/?source=govdelivery">FDA Voice</a></p>
<p>The health of every American is of the utmost importance to the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products.  Our <a title="FDA Center for Tobacco Products " href="http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/"><span style="color:#0857bf;">Center for Tobacco Products</span></a> works to improve public health, with the goal of making sure that tobacco-related death and disease is part of America’s past, not its future.National Women’s Health Week, May 13-19, provides an opportunity for us to reach out and remind the women in our lives about the dangers of tobacco use and exposure to second-hand smoke — which claims the lives of nearly 200,000 women every year.</p>
<p>Never starting to use tobacco products and quitting tobacco use – for those who do use tobacco – is proven to lead to longer and healthier lives for everyone.</p>
<p>There is no question that tobacco use is dangerous to women. Just consider a few of the facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>An estimated 173,940 women die every year due to cigarette smoking</li>
<li>An estimated 18,000 non-smoking women die every year from exposure to second-hand smoke</li>
<li>Smoking causes almost 80% of lung cancer deaths in women</li>
<li>Smoking causes cervical cancer and eight other cancers</li>
<li>Smoking causes infertility and poor pregnancy outcomes</li>
<li>Smoking causes low bone density and hip fractures in women</li>
</ul>
<p>National Women’s Health Week is the perfect time for you — or one of the important women in your life — to break a dangerous addiction to tobacco, and for those who do not use tobacco, it is a time to be empowered to never start. Need help? Here are some great resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Smoking - Medicines To Help You Quit" href="http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForWomen/ucm118667.htm"><span style="color:#0857bf;">Resources for Women to Help Quit Smoking</span></a></li>

<li><a title="FDA Center for Tobacco Products" href="http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/"><span style="color:#0857bf;">FDA Center for Tobacco Products</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>When we spend countless hours taking care of our families and friends, it’s far too easy to forget to look after our own health. This coming week, make an investment in yourself and the women who are close to you by committing to a life that’s free of tobacco-related disease and death.</p>
