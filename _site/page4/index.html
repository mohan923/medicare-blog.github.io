      <p>Choosing to stop curative treatment is a scary moment for anyone. You worry about your family, the quality of the care you’ll receive, and keeping your dignity.</p>
<p>For over 30 years Medicare has covered hospice care, so that those who are terminally ill can spend the last moments of their lives with dignity and comfort, among their loved ones. The focus is on comfort and support, not on curing an illness.</p>
<p>Deciding you need Hospice care is a difficult choice to make, and it’s important to be informed about what Hospice covers. Here are a few of the services Hospice provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Care is generally provided in the home.</li>
<li>A specially trained team of professionals and caregivers provide care for the “whole person,” including your physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs.</li>
<li>Services typically include physical care, counseling, drugs, equipment, and supplies for the terminal illness and related conditions.</li>
<li>Family caregivers can get support.</li>
<li>Once you choose hospice care, your hospice benefit should cover everything you need.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about hospice, you can visit Medicare.gov. To find a hospice program, talk to your doctor or call your state hospice organization.</p>
<p>When you need us, we’ll be here.</p>

      <p>Going through the process of buying a car takes a bit of elbow grease, but when the salesman throws in free oil changes and scheduled maintenance, it’s worth it. Not only are you saving money, but there’s a peace of mind knowing that the support you’ll need is free.</p>
<p>Extra benefits and peace of mind can be a big plus in health coverage, too.</p>
<p>If you have Medicare, you get to enjoy extra benefits thanks to the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/affordable-care-act.html">Affordable Care Act</a> like these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html">A discount of 55% on covered brand-name drugs</a> if you hit the Part D prescription drug <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/part-d-coverage-gap.html">coverage gap</a> (“donut hole”)</li>
<li>A host of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive tests and screenings</a> — including cancer screenings — most at no cost to you</li>
</ul>
<p>Medicare also covers a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly wellness exam</a> each year. This is a great chance to sit down with your doctor and take the time to talk about your needs — and address small health concerns before they become big ones. You can keep track of your preventive services and get reminders for them at <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">MyMedicare.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Also, most people with Medicare have access to Medicare Advantage Plans, and many of these plans offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn’t cover like vision, hearing, dental coverage, prescription drugs, or extended coverage when you travel.</p>
<p>Just like deciding what car to buy, only you know what extra benefits and services are most important for you and your family. During Medicare Open Enrollment, decide what benefits are most important in helping you meet your unique health care needs. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.</p>

      <p>In today’s world, we’re all a little more conscious of costs. Maybe we clip a few more coupons or compare ads to find the best price on something before we buy. With the internet, we also have a wealth of information online to help us shop around. Cost is an important factor in any purchase, and health care is no different.</p>
<p>We know you want to get the best value possible from your health care coverage. But you still need to make smart choices to get good value that meets your own health care needs. There may be dozens of Medicare plans in your area, all with different costs and levels of coverage. With all these choices, you may have questions like: How much are each plan’s premiums and deductibles? How much will you pay for the benefits and services you’re likely to use? Is there a limit on what you’ll have to pay out-of-pocket for the year? If you’re currently in a plan, how does that plan stack up to the other plans that are available?</p>
<p>Prescription drug coverage is another part of the cost puzzle. How much will your prescriptions cost under each plan? Does the plan cover the drugs you take? Remember, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, everyone who reaches the Part D coverage gap (or “donut hole”) will benefit from a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html">discount of 55% on covered brand-name drugs</a>.</p>
<p>Only you can determine what mix of benefits and costs will work best with your needs and budget. Shopping around can make a huge difference, and we want to help. The <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a> makes it easy to compare plans so you can pick a plan that meets your needs. After you’ve narrowed your options, you can call the plans you’re interested in to get more details about their benefits and services, or check out their websites.</p>
<p>Whether it’s groceries, health insurance, or anything else, you want value for your dollar. Make sure you have the most up-to-date information that’s available.</p>

      <p>Fall is picking season – pumpkins, apples, Halloween candy…and a Medicare health or drug plan. Today’s the start of Medicare Open Enrollment!</p>
<p>Picking a plan is an important and personal decision. Now’s the time to think about what matters to you, and to pick the Medicare plan that meets your needs. Here are some things to think about:</p>
<p><strong>Does the plan cover the services you need? </strong></p>
<p>Future health care needs can be hard to predict, but changes happen. Make sure you understand what services and benefits you’re likely to use in the coming year and find coverage that meets your needs. If you have other types of health or prescription drug coverage, make sure you understand <a href="http://medicare.gov/supplement-other-insurance/how-medicare-works-with-other-insurance/how-medicare-works-with-other-insurance.html">how that coverage works with Medicare</a>. And, if you travel a lot, does your plan cover you when you’re away from home?</p>
<p>No matter what plan you pick, you’ll have better choices and more benefits thanks to the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/affordable-care-act.html">Affordable Care Act</a> like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>A discount of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html">55% on covered brand-name drugs</a> if you hit the Part D prescription drug coverage gap (“donut hole”)</li>
<li>A free <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly “wellness” visit</a>, so you can sit down with your doctor and talk about your health concerns and the best ways to stay healthy</li>
<li>A host of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive tests and screenings</a> — including cancer screenings — most at no cost to you</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What’s the cost? </strong></p>
<p>The lowest-cost health plan option might not be the best choice for you – consider things like the cost of premiums and deductibles, how much you pay for hospital stays and doctor visits, and whether it’s important for you to have expenses balanced throughout the year.</p>
<p><strong>How about convenience? </strong></p>
<p>Your time is valuable. Where are the doctors’ offices? What are their hours? Which pharmacies can you use? Can you get prescriptions by mail? Do the doctors use <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-health-records/electronic-health-records.html">electronic health records</a> or <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-prescribing/electronic-prescribing.html">prescribe electronically</a>?</p>
<p><strong>Quality is important!</strong></p>
<p>Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. Open Enrollment is also a good time to ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Look for plans</a> with a 5‑star performance rating — the right expertise and care can make a difference.</p>
<p>Remember that even if you’re happy with your current plan, these answers might change from year to year – so it’s important to take the time to compare. The <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a> makes it easy to compare plans based on all of these factors, so you can pick a plan that meets your needs.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>Did you know colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States among cancers that affect both men and women? More than 90% of cases occur in people who are 50 years old or older. More men than women get colon cancer, and 1 or 2 out of every 100 men who are 60 today will develop colon cancer by age 70.</p>
<p>Starting today, people with Medicare who don’t show symptoms of colorectal cancer will have access to the Cologuard™ multi-target stool DNA test, a first-of-its-kind test. It’s being covered more quickly than usual by Medicare through a pilot program run jointly by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Medicare. Medicare and the FDA are working together to get you state-of-the-art treatments faster.</p>
<p>In most cases, colorectal cancer develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Cologuard™ studies a patient’s stool sample to see if there’s DNA code that suggests either the presence of precancerous polyps or colorectal cancer. This way, your doctors can find these polyps and you can get them removed before they turn into cancer.</p>
<p>Medicare Part B covers the Cologuard™ test <strong>once every 3 years</strong> for people with Medicare who meet <strong>all</strong> of these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between 50 and 85 years old</li>
<li>Show no signs or symptoms of colorectal disease including, but not limited to, lower gastrointestinal pain, blood in stool, positive guaiac fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test, and</li>
<li>At average risk of developing colorectal cancer—have no personal history of adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis; and have no family history of colorectal cancers or adenomatous polyps, familial adenomatous polyposis, or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer</li>
</ul>
<p>Cologuard™ is one of several tools that Medicare covers to detect colorectal cancer. Talk with your doctor about which <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/colorectal-cancer-screenings.html">colorectal cancer screenings</a> you should try.</p>
