      <p>In today’s world, we’re all a little more conscious of costs. Maybe we clip a few more coupons or compare ads to find the best price on something before we buy. With the internet, we also have a wealth of information online to help us shop around. Cost is an important factor in any purchase, and health care is no different.</p>
<p>We know you want to get the best value possible from your health care coverage. But you still need to make smart choices to get good value that meets your own health care needs. There may be dozens of Medicare plans in your area, all with different costs and levels of coverage. With all these choices, you may have questions like: How much are each plan’s premiums and deductibles? How much will you pay for the benefits and services you’re likely to use? Is there a limit on what you’ll have to pay out-of-pocket for the year? If you’re currently in a plan, how does that plan stack up to the other plans that are available?</p>
<p>Prescription drug coverage is another part of the cost puzzle. How much will your prescriptions cost under each plan? Does the plan cover the drugs you take? Remember, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, everyone who reaches the Part D coverage gap (or “donut hole”) will benefit from a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html">discount of 55% on covered brand-name drugs</a>.</p>
<p>Only you can determine what mix of benefits and costs will work best with your needs and budget. Shopping around can make a huge difference, and we want to help. The <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a> makes it easy to compare plans so you can pick a plan that meets your needs. After you’ve narrowed your options, you can call the plans you’re interested in to get more details about their benefits and services, or check out their websites.</p>
<p>Whether it’s groceries, health insurance, or anything else, you want value for your dollar. Make sure you have the most up-to-date information that’s available.</p>

      <p>Fall is picking season – pumpkins, apples, Halloween candy…and a Medicare health or drug plan. Today’s the start of Medicare Open Enrollment!</p>
<p>Picking a plan is an important and personal decision. Now’s the time to think about what matters to you, and to pick the Medicare plan that meets your needs. Here are some things to think about:</p>
<p><strong>Does the plan cover the services you need? </strong></p>
<p>Future health care needs can be hard to predict, but changes happen. Make sure you understand what services and benefits you’re likely to use in the coming year and find coverage that meets your needs. If you have other types of health or prescription drug coverage, make sure you understand <a href="http://medicare.gov/supplement-other-insurance/how-medicare-works-with-other-insurance/how-medicare-works-with-other-insurance.html">how that coverage works with Medicare</a>. And, if you travel a lot, does your plan cover you when you’re away from home?</p>
<p>No matter what plan you pick, you’ll have better choices and more benefits thanks to the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/affordable-care-act.html">Affordable Care Act</a> like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>A discount of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html">55% on covered brand-name drugs</a> if you hit the Part D prescription drug coverage gap (“donut hole”)</li>
<li>A free <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly “wellness” visit</a>, so you can sit down with your doctor and talk about your health concerns and the best ways to stay healthy</li>
<li>A host of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive tests and screenings</a> — including cancer screenings — most at no cost to you</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What’s the cost? </strong></p>
<p>The lowest-cost health plan option might not be the best choice for you – consider things like the cost of premiums and deductibles, how much you pay for hospital stays and doctor visits, and whether it’s important for you to have expenses balanced throughout the year.</p>
<p><strong>How about convenience? </strong></p>
<p>Your time is valuable. Where are the doctors’ offices? What are their hours? Which pharmacies can you use? Can you get prescriptions by mail? Do the doctors use <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-health-records/electronic-health-records.html">electronic health records</a> or <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-prescribing/electronic-prescribing.html">prescribe electronically</a>?</p>
<p><strong>Quality is important!</strong></p>
<p>Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. Open Enrollment is also a good time to ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Look for plans</a> with a 5‑star performance rating — the right expertise and care can make a difference.</p>
<p>Remember that even if you’re happy with your current plan, these answers might change from year to year – so it’s important to take the time to compare. The <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a> makes it easy to compare plans based on all of these factors, so you can pick a plan that meets your needs.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>Did you know colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States among cancers that affect both men and women? More than 90% of cases occur in people who are 50 years old or older. More men than women get colon cancer, and 1 or 2 out of every 100 men who are 60 today will develop colon cancer by age 70.</p>
<p>Starting today, people with Medicare who don’t show symptoms of colorectal cancer will have access to the Cologuard™ multi-target stool DNA test, a first-of-its-kind test. It’s being covered more quickly than usual by Medicare through a pilot program run jointly by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Medicare. Medicare and the FDA are working together to get you state-of-the-art treatments faster.</p>
<p>In most cases, colorectal cancer develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Cologuard™ studies a patient’s stool sample to see if there’s DNA code that suggests either the presence of precancerous polyps or colorectal cancer. This way, your doctors can find these polyps and you can get them removed before they turn into cancer.</p>
<p>Medicare Part B covers the Cologuard™ test <strong>once every 3 years</strong> for people with Medicare who meet <strong>all</strong> of these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between 50 and 85 years old</li>
<li>Show no signs or symptoms of colorectal disease including, but not limited to, lower gastrointestinal pain, blood in stool, positive guaiac fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test, and</li>
<li>At average risk of developing colorectal cancer—have no personal history of adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis; and have no family history of colorectal cancers or adenomatous polyps, familial adenomatous polyposis, or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer</li>
</ul>
<p>Cologuard™ is one of several tools that Medicare covers to detect colorectal cancer. Talk with your doctor about which <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/colorectal-cancer-screenings.html">colorectal cancer screenings</a> you should try.</p>

      <p>As the days get shorter and the nights get cooler, you can already see the leaves starting to change. Like the changing leaves, the fall also brings your chance to make changes to your Medicare coverage. That’s because October 15 – December 7 is Medicare Open Enrollment. It’s your chance to review your health care coverage and see if you need to make any changes for next year. Or, you may decide you’re happy with the plan you have now. If that’s the case, and the plan is still being offered next year, you don’t need to do anything.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, look around – you’ll find a wealth of information about your Medicare benefits, especially in these everyday places:</p>
<p><strong>1. In the mail</strong></p>
<p>Look through your mail carefully — you may get important notices from your current plan, Medicare, or Social Security about changes to your coverage or any <a title="Extra Help" href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/save-on-drug-costs/save-on-drug-costs.html">Extra Help</a> you may get paying for prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Also, look for your Medicare &amp; You handbook. It contains information about all of the Medicare plans in your area. If you decided to “<a href="https://www.medicare.gov/gopaperless/home.aspx">go paperless</a>,” you’ll get an email pointing you to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/medicare-and-you/medicare-and-you.html">Medicare.gov</a> where you can get all the same information.</p>
<p>You’ll also start to see brochures from companies that offer Medicare health and drug plans. Just remember,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/forms-help-and-resources/report-fraud-and-abuse/prevent-fraud/tips-to-prevent-fraud.html"> be smart about protecting your personal information and your identity</a> — plans aren’t allowed to call or come to your home without an invitation from you.</p>
<p><strong>2. On your computer </strong></p>
<p>Comparing your plan choices is important. Our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> is ready with all of the 2015 health and drug plan cost information to make it as easy as possible. Enter the drugs you take to find out how you can lower your costs and review the plan’s ratings to compare plan quality. If you find a plan that meets your needs, you’ll be able to join the plan right online starting October 15. If you haven’t used the Plan Finder before, check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SCvgSZURBA#t=34">video</a> to help you get started.</p>
<p><strong>3. In your community</strong></p>
<p>Take a moment as you enjoy these crisp mornings to review the Medicare information that’s out there. You may find a local event — somewhere right around the corner with counselors to help you, like your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/contacts">State Health Insurance Assistance Program</a>. Don’t miss the chance to get personalized help if you need it!</p>
