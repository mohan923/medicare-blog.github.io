      <p>If you’re planning a vacation abroad this summer, you already know that there’s a lot to do before you leave. There are suitcases to pack, an itinerary to plan, and perhaps a passport to renew. We want you to have the most relaxing vacation possible, so before you go don’t forget to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look into Medicare coverage outside the United States.</li>
<li>Think about getting additional health care coverage.</li>
</ol>
<p>You already have Medicare, so your health care services and supplies are covered when you’re in the U.S., (including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands). When you travel overseas or outside the U.S. (including to Canada or Mexico), it’s important to know how your Medicare works.</p>
<p>In most cases, Medicare <strong>won’t</strong> pay for health care services or supplies you get outside the U.S. Medicare may pay for health care and services you get outside the U.S. <a href="http://medicare.gov/coverage/travel-need-health-care-outside-us.html">in these rare cases</a>.</p>
<p>Because Medicare coverage outside the U.S. is limited, you may want to buy a travel insurance policy. To find out more about these policies, talk to an insurance or travel agent. Not all travel policies include health insurance, so ask questions and read the terms and conditions carefully.</p>
<p>Taking the time to plan out your health care coverage before you travel abroad will help you to have an enjoyable and relaxing trip. For more information on how to stay healthy abroad, visit the Centers for Disease Control’s <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/">Traveler’s Health page</a>.</p>

      <p>Will a silent disease shatter your life?  Every year, a growing number of Americans are finding out that they have osteoporosis-a disease that causes bones to weaken and be more likely to break.  Medicare <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html">can help</a> you prevent or detect osteoporosis at an early stage, when treatment works best.  Learn the facts so you can protect your bones!</p>
<p>Many people believe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Osteoporosis is a natural part of aging that only affects older women</li>
<li>Bone loss can’t be treated once it starts</li>
<li>The only risk of osteoporosis is broken bones from falls</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these myths are true.  What is true is:</p>
<ul>
<li>While 1 in 3 women over 50 will develop osteoporosis, 1 in 5 men will, too</li>
<li>It is possible to make bones stronger</li>
<li>Around 25 % of people die within the first 6 to 12 months after a hip fracture</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, there are many ways to prevent or lessen the severity of osteoporosis.  Making sure you get enough calcium, vitamin D, and exercise are 3 important ways to make your bones stronger.  May is National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month.  Talk to your doctor about getting a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html">bone mass measurement</a>—it may be free.</p>

      <p>Reminders to take care of your physical health are all around you– on the web, in television ads, and from concerned family members. What you may not remember is that taking care of your mental health is just as important! May is National Mental Health Month, so we’re making an effort to spread the word about all of the mental health resources available to people with Medicare.</p>
<p>Medicare helps cover <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/outpatient-mental-health-care.html">outpatient</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/inpatient-mental-health-care.html">inpatient</a> mental health care, as well as <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/partial-hospitalization-mental-health-care.html">partial hospitalization</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/depression-screenings.html">screenings for depression</a>. If you have Medicare prescription drug coverage, you can also get medications to help treat a mental health condition.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mentalhealth.gov/">Mental health</a> includes your emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how you think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how you handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. If you experience mental health problems your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected.</p>
<p>- Mental health problems are common and can be caused by many factors:</p>
<p>- Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry</p>
<p>- Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse</p>
<p>- Family history of mental health problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Remember: </strong> taking care of your health is about more than just your physical health – it’s about taking care of all of you! Medicare is here to help you take care of your mental health, and remind you that <strong>you’re not alone</strong> -- we’re here to support you.</p>

      <header class="entry-header"><!-- .entry-header -->Did you know that 1.2 million people in the U.S. have chronic Hepatitis B, but many more people don’t know they’re infected because they have no symptoms? Hepatitis B is a contagious liver disease that can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious illness that can lead to liver disease or liver cancer.</header>
<div class="entry-content post_content">
<p>Medicare can help keep you protected from Hepatitis B. The best way to prevent Hepatitis B is by getting the Hepatitis B vaccine, which is usually given as 3 shots over a 6-month period. You need to get all 3 shots for complete coverage. If you’re at high or medium risk for Hepatitis B, Medicare Part B will cover <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hepatitis-b-shots.html">Hepatitis B shots</a> for free.</p>
<p>Are you at risk for getting Hepatitis B? If you have hemophilia, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/glossary/e.html#esrd">End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)</a>, diabetes, or certain conditions that lower your resistance to infection, you have a higher risk for getting Hepatitis B increases. Additionally, if you have a profession that puts you in frequent contact with blood or bodily fluids, you may be at a higher risk.</p>
<p>May is Hepatitis Awareness month. To find out more about preventing and treating Hepatitis B, visit the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/B/index.htm">Centers for Disease Control</a>.</p>
