      <p>As the days get shorter and the nights get cooler, you can already see the leaves starting to change. Like the changing leaves, the fall also brings your chance to make changes to your Medicare coverage. That’s because October 15 – December 7 is Medicare Open Enrollment. It’s your chance to review your health care coverage and see if you need to make any changes for next year. Or, you may decide you’re happy with the plan you have now. If that’s the case, and the plan is still being offered next year, you don’t need to do anything.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, look around – you’ll find a wealth of information about your Medicare benefits, especially in these everyday places:</p>
<p><strong>1. In the mail</strong></p>
<p>Look through your mail carefully — you may get important notices from your current plan, Medicare, or Social Security about changes to your coverage or any <a title="Extra Help" href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/save-on-drug-costs/save-on-drug-costs.html">Extra Help</a> you may get paying for prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Also, look for your Medicare &amp; You handbook. It contains information about all of the Medicare plans in your area. If you decided to “<a href="https://www.medicare.gov/gopaperless/home.aspx">go paperless</a>,” you’ll get an email pointing you to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/medicare-and-you/medicare-and-you.html">Medicare.gov</a> where you can get all the same information.</p>
<p>You’ll also start to see brochures from companies that offer Medicare health and drug plans. Just remember,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/forms-help-and-resources/report-fraud-and-abuse/prevent-fraud/tips-to-prevent-fraud.html"> be smart about protecting your personal information and your identity</a> — plans aren’t allowed to call or come to your home without an invitation from you.</p>
<p><strong>2. On your computer </strong></p>
<p>Comparing your plan choices is important. Our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> is ready with all of the 2015 health and drug plan cost information to make it as easy as possible. Enter the drugs you take to find out how you can lower your costs and review the plan’s ratings to compare plan quality. If you find a plan that meets your needs, you’ll be able to join the plan right online starting October 15. If you haven’t used the Plan Finder before, check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SCvgSZURBA#t=34">video</a> to help you get started.</p>
<p><strong>3. In your community</strong></p>
<p>Take a moment as you enjoy these crisp mornings to review the Medicare information that’s out there. You may find a local event — somewhere right around the corner with counselors to help you, like your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/contacts">State Health Insurance Assistance Program</a>. Don’t miss the chance to get personalized help if you need it!</p>

      <p>Mammograms are breast cancer screening tests that can detect a lump before you or your doctor can feel it. This helps to detect breast cancer early, when it’s most treatable. All women over 40 should have a mammogram every 12 months – and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/mammograms.html">Medicare covers it at no cost</a> if your doctor accepts assignment. Talk to your doctor about risk factors and to schedule your next screening.</p>
<p>October is Breast Cancer Awareness month, so let’s spread the word on the fight against breast cancer.</p>

      <p>Are you getting physical therapy after a hip replacement? Speech-language pathology services after a stroke? Anytime you get outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech-language pathology services, be sure you know the limits for how much Medicare will pay.</p>
<p>Medicare helps pay for medically-necessary outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services. There are limits, called “therapy caps,” on these services when you get them from most outpatient providers.</p>
<p>The therapy cap limits for 2014 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,920 for physical therapy (PT) and speech-language pathology (SLP) services combined</li>
<li>$1,920 for occupational therapy (OT) services</li>
</ul>
<p>You may qualify to get an exception so that Medicare will continue to pay its share for your services after you reach the therapy cap limits.</p>
<p>October is National Physical Therapy Month – take the time to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/pt-and-ot-and-speech-language-pathology.html">learn more</a> about Medicare’s limits on therapy services.</p>

      <p>Are you taking precautions to make sure you stay healthy?  Just like you take your car for scheduled maintenance, it’s important to do what you can to take care of your body.  Medicare covers many <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive services</a>, and we make it easy for you to get these 3 shots:</p>
<ol>
<li><a title="Click here to view Flu Shots" href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/flu-shots.html"><b>Flu Shots</b></a>—Covered once a flu season in the fall or winter.<b> </b></li>
<li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hepatitis-b-shots.html"><b>Hepatitis B Shots</b></a><b>—</b>Covered for people at high or medium risk for Hepatitis B (usually a series of 3 shots).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/pneumococcal-shots.html"><b>Pneumococcal Shot</b></a><b>—</b>Covered to help prevent pneumococcal infections (like certain types of pneumonia). Most people only need this shot once in their lifetime.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we approach the fall, you’ll see these shots offered in many places, such as your local pharmacy, so make sure you take advantage of them. You pay nothing as long as the supplier or doctor accepts assignment for giving the shot.</p>
<p>A strong immune system is way more important than your car, so make the time to stay healthy and take a few minutes to watch our video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncDOTyjryWo">National Immunization Awareness Month</a>.</p>
