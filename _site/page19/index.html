      <p><em><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">By: Julie Green Bataille, Director of Communications </span></span></em></p>
<p>If you’re like me, fall is an extremely busy time of year—getting the kids ready for a new school year, making sure everyone in my family gets a flu shot, getting the house and yard ready for the winter. With everything we have going on, it’s so easy to forget another activity that should be on all our fall checklists: Helping our parents prepare for Medicare Open Enrollment.</p>
<p>Medicare Open Enrollment gives beneficiaries the chance to review their health and prescription drug coverage for the coming year. If they need to make any changes, they can do so between October 15 and December 7. But if they decide that they’re happy sticking with the coverage they have now, they don’t need to do anything else.</p>
<p>For all of us who are caregivers, or who just care about older parents and family members, we need to ensure that they have the right information to make the right choice. Sit down and have a conversation with them, and help them explore their options and find coverage that fits their needs.</p>
<p>If your parents want to go online and sort through the details, they can get an early start, and you can help them navigate the process if needed. We’ve already made sure that the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> is fully updated with all new 2013 cost and benefit information for health and drug plans and is ready right now. All your parents need to do is start by entering the drugs and checking on the doctors and pharmacies they want to use. A few more steps will get them a personalized list of their plan choices and help them compare.</p>
<p>Between now and December 7, your parents will be hearing more about the choices, benefits, and lower overall costs they’ll have when it comes to Medicare. We’ll also be adding tips and advice to this blog, to help them you and them consider and weigh choices, and to find places to go to get help if needed.</p>
<p>When Medicare Open Enrollment ends on December 7, we want every single person with Medicare to have health and drug coverage that meets their needs. But we need your help. We need you to help ensure that your older family members have the right health plan.  So when you’re preparing your fall checklist, don’t forget to put Medicare Open Enrollment at the top.</p>

      <p>Have you had your mammogram this year?</p>
<p>Mammograms are breast cancer screening tests that can often detect a lump before you or your doctor can feel it. This can help detect breast cancer early, when it’s the most treatable. All women over 40 should have a screening mammogram every 12 months – and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/mammograms.html"><span style="color:#800080;">Medicare covers it at no cost</span></a> if your doctor accepts assignment.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about risk factors, and to schedule your next screening. Take control of your health – better health is in your hands.</p>

      <p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Are you getting physical therapy after a hip replacement? Speech-language pathology services after a stroke? Anytime you get outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy or speech-language pathology services, be sure you know the limits for how much Medicare will pay.</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/pt-and-ot-and-speech-language-pathology.html"><span style="font-family:Calibri;color:#800080;font-size:medium;">Medicare helps pay for</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:medium;"> <span style="color:#000000;">medically-necessary outpatient physical and occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services. There are limits, called “therapy caps,” on these services when you get them from most outpatient providers.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;">The therapy cap amounts for 2012 are: </span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:medium;">$1,880 for physical therapy (PT) and speech-language pathology (SLP) services combined</span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">$1,880 for occupational therapy (OT) services</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">You may qualify to get an exception so that Medicare will continue to pay its share for your services after you reach the therapy cap limits. Your therapist must document your need for medically-necessary services in your medical record, and your therapist’s billing office must indicate on your claim for services above the therapy cap that your outpatient therapy services are medically necessary. </span></span></span></p>
