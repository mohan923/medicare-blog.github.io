      <p>Did you know that approximately 1 in 5 of the more than 1 million Americans infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) don't know they’re carrying the virus?</p>
<p>Medicare covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hiv-screening.html">HIV screening</a> for people with Medicare of any age who ask for the test, pregnant women, and people at increased risk for the infection (such as gay and bisexual men, injection drug users, or people with multiple sexual partners).</p>
<p>HIV is the virus that can lead to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS.Early testing and diagnosis play key roles in reducing the spread of the disease, extending life expectancy, and cutting costs of care. At least 1 in 3 people in the U.S. who test positive for HIV is tested too late to get the full advantage of treatment. Testing is also an important first step in getting HIV-infected people the medical care and support they need to improve their health and help them maintain safer behaviors.</p>

      <p>Are you the type of guy who puts off doing a task and later wishes he’d just done it? If you’re a man with Medicare, now’s the time to talk with your doctor about whether you should get screened for<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/prostate-cancer-screenings.html">prostate cancer</a>, for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/colorectal-cancer-screenings.html">colorectal cancer</a>, or for both. Even if you’re feeling fine, screening tests can find cancer early, when treatment works best.</p>
<p>Don’t put off screenings if you’re worried about the cost: Medicare covers a digital rectal exam and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test once every 12 months if you’re a man with Medicare who’s 50 or over. Also, Medicare also covers several types of colorectal cancer screenings, and you pay nothing for most tests.</p>
<p>Did you know prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, second only to lung cancer in the number of total male cancer deaths? You’re at higher risk for getting prostate cancer if you’re a man 50 or older, are African-American, or have a father, brother, or son who has had prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Colorectal cancer is also common among men—in fact, it’s the third most commonly diagnosed cancer diagnosed in both men <strong>and</strong> women in the US and the third leading cause of cancer death. In most cases, colorectal cancer develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Fortunately, screening tests can find these polyps, so you can get them removed before they turn into cancer.</p>
<p>Your risk of getting colorectal cancer goes up as you age. If everyone 50 or older got screened regularly, we could avoid as many as 60% of deaths from this cancer. Make sure you get screened regularly for colorectal cancer if you’re 50 or older, or have a personal or family history of colorectal issues.</p>
<p>June is Men’s Health Month, a perfect time for you (and the men in your life) to take the steps to live a safer, healthier life. Watch our videos on how Medicare has you covered on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcM0wptOIJg">prostate cancer</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HPJp3VYdfg">colorectal cancer</a> screenings, and visit the Centers for Disease Control for more information on <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/men/index.htm">men’s health</a>.</p>

      <p>If you’re planning a vacation abroad this summer, you already know that there’s a lot to do before you leave. There are suitcases to pack, an itinerary to plan, and perhaps a passport to renew. We want you to have the most relaxing vacation possible, so before you go don’t forget to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look into Medicare coverage outside the United States.</li>
<li>Think about getting additional health care coverage.</li>
</ol>
<p>You already have Medicare, so your health care services and supplies are covered when you’re in the U.S., (including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands). When you travel overseas or outside the U.S. (including to Canada or Mexico), it’s important to know how your Medicare works.</p>
<p>In most cases, Medicare <strong>won’t</strong> pay for health care services or supplies you get outside the U.S. Medicare may pay for health care and services you get outside the U.S. <a href="http://medicare.gov/coverage/travel-need-health-care-outside-us.html">in these rare cases</a>.</p>
<p>Because Medicare coverage outside the U.S. is limited, you may want to buy a travel insurance policy. To find out more about these policies, talk to an insurance or travel agent. Not all travel policies include health insurance, so ask questions and read the terms and conditions carefully.</p>
<p>Taking the time to plan out your health care coverage before you travel abroad will help you to have an enjoyable and relaxing trip. For more information on how to stay healthy abroad, visit the Centers for Disease Control’s <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/">Traveler’s Health page</a>.</p>

      <p>Will a silent disease shatter your life?  Every year, a growing number of Americans are finding out that they have osteoporosis-a disease that causes bones to weaken and be more likely to break.  Medicare <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html">can help</a> you prevent or detect osteoporosis at an early stage, when treatment works best.  Learn the facts so you can protect your bones!</p>
<p>Many people believe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Osteoporosis is a natural part of aging that only affects older women</li>
<li>Bone loss can’t be treated once it starts</li>
<li>The only risk of osteoporosis is broken bones from falls</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these myths are true.  What is true is:</p>
<ul>
<li>While 1 in 3 women over 50 will develop osteoporosis, 1 in 5 men will, too</li>
<li>It is possible to make bones stronger</li>
<li>Around 25 % of people die within the first 6 to 12 months after a hip fracture</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, there are many ways to prevent or lessen the severity of osteoporosis.  Making sure you get enough calcium, vitamin D, and exercise are 3 important ways to make your bones stronger.  May is National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month.  Talk to your doctor about getting a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html">bone mass measurement</a>—it may be free.</p>
