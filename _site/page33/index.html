      <p>The health care providers and facilities you choose can affect your health – finding the right expertise and specialists may speed your recovery and improve how well your treatment works. We’ve just updated <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/home.asp">Nursing Home Compare</a> and the <a href="http://www.hospitalcompare.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Hospital Compare</a> with more information to help you compare health care facilities. And our new <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/qualitycarefinder">Quality Care Finder</a> is updated regularly to provide you with an easy way to search for health care professionals, services, and facilities.</p>
<p>Use these resources to make informed decisions about which facilities you choose:<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Nursing Homes</strong><br />
Medicare’s <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/home.asp">Nursing Home Compare</a> now has information about:</p>
<p>-          Nursing home health inspections and what happens after a facility is inspected</p>
<p>-          Complaints filed about a nursing home in the last 3 years</p>
<p>-          Incidents that a nursing home self-reported in the last 3 years</p>
<p>-          Enforcements, which are monetary penalties and denials of payments, that a nursing home received in the last 3 years</p>
<p>This information, along with the existing measures including quality of care and staffing, can help you compare the care you’ll get at different nursing homes and the specialties they offer. You can now read complaints filed at each nursing home, and find out how they affected residents’ care. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/nursing/checklist.pdf">Nursing Home Checklist</a> to track information about different nursing homes you visit.</p>
<p><strong>VA Hospitals</strong><br />
The <a href="http://www.hospitalcompare.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Hospital Compare</a> helps Veterans compare the quality of care at VA hospitals based on:</p>
<p>-          Reducing preventable surgical complications (part of the Surgical Care Improvement Project) including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infections</li>
<li>Blood clots</li>
<li>Heart (cardiac) problems</li>
<li>Breathing (respiratory) problems</li>
</ul>
<p>-          Measures about death (mortality) rates, readmissions to the hospital, and best treatments for these medical conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Congestive Heart Failure</li>
<li>Heart Attack</li>
<li>Pneumonia</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s been a big summer for the millions of Americans who are benefitting from improved Medicare coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act. The benefits are clear: More people are getting preventive services to keep them healthy and people with high prescription drug costs are seeing the <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/donuthole.html">donut hole coverage gap</a> starting to close – lowering the cost of drugs so that people don’t have to worry about being able to afford the care they need. Take a look at the past few months:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>June:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Through the end of June, 899,000 Americans with Medicare have benefited from the discount on brand name drugs in the Medicare Part D "donut hole" coverage gap -- an increase of over 420,000 individuals in the month of June alone.</li>
<li>These discounts have saved seniors and people with disabilities a total of $461 million, including $200 million in June alone!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>July:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Through the end of July, 17.3 million people with traditional Medicare, or 51.5 percent, have received one of more free preventive services. </li>
<li>During the same time period, over 1 million Americans with traditional Medicare have taken advantage of Medicare’s new free Annual Wellness Visit, up from 780,000 in mid-June;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about these new benefits, check out the Medicare campaign, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/share-the-health/"><em>“Share the News, Share the Health”</em></a>, to learn about the importance of prevention for people with Medicare.</p>
<p>But the good news doesn’t stop here. Over the coming years, provisions of the Affordable Care Act will help close the donut hole coverage gap completely. Here is a sense of what Medicare beneficiaries can look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2013:</strong> You will pay less and less for your brand-name Part D prescription drugs in the donut hole.</li>
<li><strong>2020:</strong> The coverage gap will be closed, meaning there will be no more “donut hole,” and you will only pay 25% of the costs of your drugs until you reach the yearly out-of-pocket spending limit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chart below shows Medicare prescription drug savings over time:</p>

      <p>Keeping your immune system strong is a lifelong, life-protecting job, but we’ve got you covered. Your Medicare <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/share-the-health/index.html">preventive benefits</a> include three shots:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Click here to view Flu Shots" href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/flu-shots.aspx"><strong>Flu Shots</strong></a>—Covered once a flu season in the fall or winter. <strong></strong></li>
<li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/hepititis-b-shots.aspx"><strong>Hepatitis B Shots</strong></a><strong>—</strong>Covered for people at high or medium risk for Hepatitis B (usually a series of three shots).<strong></strong></li>
<li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/pneumococcal-shot.aspx"><strong>Pneumococcal Shot</strong></a><strong>—</strong>Covered to help prevent pneumococcal infections (like certain types of pneumonia). Most people only need this shot once in their lifetime. <strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Getting your shots has never been easier. As we approach the fall season, you will see these shots offered in many places, such as your local pharmacy, so make sure you take advantage of them. As long as the supplier or doctor accepts assignment for giving the shot, you pay nothing.</p>

<p><em>By Don Berwick, Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Cross-post from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/medicare07282011.html">Healthcare.gov</a></em></p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Do you have Medicare? Have questions about what the Affordable Care Act does for you?</p>
<p>Here are the five things people with Medicare should know about the law:</p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/prescription/drugdiscounts.html">It makes prescription drugs more affordable.</a></strong></p>
<p>If you enter the coverage gap known as the “donut hole,” you will receive a 50% discount when buying Part D-covered brand-name prescription drugs. This discount will be automatically applied at the counter of your pharmacy; you don’t have to do anything to get it. And over the next ten years, you will get additional savings until the coverage gap is completely closed in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/preventive-service-overview.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1"><strong>It gives you preventive care services for free.</strong></a></p>
<p>If you have Medicare, you can get free preventive screenings and services like colorectal cancer screening and mammograms. You can also get a free yearly wellness visit to develop and update your personal prevention plan based on current health needs. Again, these services are free: no co-pays or cost-sharing for you.</p>
<p><strong>3. <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/center/programs/partnership/">It provides incentives for your doctors to work together for you.</a></strong></p>
<p>The law makes it easier for your doctors to work together by offering them support and resources for patient-centered care.  If you’re hospitalized, the new law also helps you return home successfully—and avoid going back—by helping to coordinate your care and connecting you to services and support in your community.</p>
<p><strong>4. It strengthens Medicare Advantage.</strong></p>
<p>If you have Medicare Advantage, you will be protected from large increases to your premiums or decreases in your benefits.  Medicare reviews changes to your plan before they happen to stop the ones that are unreasonable. Beginning in 2012, Medicare Advantage plans will have even more reason to improve the quality of care you receive.  Plans that have a rating of three stars or more on the quality rating system will receive a bonus, part of the national effort to improve quality.</p>
<p><strong>5. It helps ensure your access to care.</strong></p>
<p>You can still choose your doctor. The law increases the number of primary care doctors, nurses, and physician assistants to provide better access to care through expanded training opportunities, student loan forgiveness, and bonus payments. Support for community health centers will increase, allowing them to serve some 20 million new patients.</p>
