<p><em>By Mayra Alvarez, Director of Public Health Policy, HHS. Crosspost from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/Disparities06102011.html">Healthcare.gov</a></em></p>

<p>Today, we posted a new <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/disparities06092011a.html">factsheet</a> outlining the many ways in which the Affordable Care Act will reduce health disparities across the U.S. All across the country, low-income Americans, racial and ethnic minorities, LGBT, and other underserved populations have not had adequate access to health care.</p>
<p>This means, these underserved populations are not able to take advantage of preventive services available to help them stay healthy and fight chronic disease. Now, thanks to the Affordable Care Act:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Healthy choices will be made easy and affordable.</strong> All insurance plans will provide more Americans access to preventive services. Medicare and some private insurance plans will now cover recommended preventive services and states will be encouraged to do the same in Medicaid.</li>
<li><strong>Access to quality health care in underserved communities will be improved.</strong> Over the next 5 years, the law provides $1 billion in funding for the operation, expansion and construction of community health centers across the country and invests in healthcare workforce programs.</li>
<li><strong>Programs will be better targeted through advance scientific knowledge and innovation.</strong> The law invests in implementation of a new health data collection to identify and reduce disparities.</li>
<li><strong>Create a fairer and easier way to understand the health care system.</strong> In 2014 insurance discrimination will be banned. A new, competitive health insurance marketplace will be created in 2014 to enable people to “one-stop-shop” and choose quality, affordable health insurance.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on HHS’ commitment to reducing health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities, check out the <a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/HHS/HHS_Plan_complete.pdf">HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities</a>, which was announced this past April. Built on the strong foundation of the Affordable Care Act, the HHS Action plan is aligned with programs such as Healthy People 2020, the First Lady’s <em>Let’s Move</em> initiative, and the President’s National HIV/AIDS Strategy. This Action Plan outlines the goals and actions HHS will take to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities by promoting integrated approaches and best practices to reduce these striking disparities.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>By Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services</p>
<p>Cross-posted from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/prevention06062011a.html">HealthCare.gov</a></p>
<p>There’s nothing more important than health. It’s what allows us to do our jobs, spend time with friends, and watch our children grow old. For America, the health of our citizens is the foundation of our prosperity. Healthy adults are more productive workers. Healthy children are better students. Healthy families can make longer-lasting contributions to their communities.</p>
<div>
<p>We know there’s more to good health than going to the hospital when you get sick. Good health starts with steps we can all take to avoid getting sick in the first place, from getting regular check-ups, vaccinations, and recommended screenings, to eating a healthy diet and getting enough exercise.</p>
<p>In the past, our health care system functioned more like a sick care system. Even though seven of ten deaths in America and three quarters of our nation’s health expenditures are due to chronic diseases, we were investing only 4 cents of every health care dollar in prevention - the kind of care to keep people from getting diseases in the first place.</p>
<p>That is changing under the Obama Administration, and this June, we are marking our nation’s first-ever <em>Prevention and Wellness Month</em>. Over the next month, you can look forward to announcements, activities, and tips that will help you and your family get healthy and stay healthy.</p>
<p>For example, Americans now have new health benefits thanks to the health care law President Obama signed last year. Millions of people can now get cancer screenings like mammograms and colonoscopies, as well as vaccinations and counseling for chronic conditions like obesity, smoking, and depression, at no additional cost. And Medicare beneficiaries can now have a yearly health checkup with their doctor to develop and update a personalized wellness plan without having to pay anything out of pocket.</p>
<p>People want to make healthy eating choices for themselves and their families, so we’re putting more information in their hands. For example, we’re working with the food industry so that restaurants make their menu items easier to understand for health-conscious diners, and we’re working with food producers to improve and standardize nutrition labeling on the front and back of the package.</p>
<p>Everyone has a role to play in shaping America’s health. The good news is that communities across America have already been leading the way. Neighbors are planting community gardens, parents are organizing after-school programs, and local advocates are building new park trails. A big part of our health strategy is simply supporting these communities and sharing their ideas, so that they can become role models for the rest of the country.</p>
<p>And we know there are more good ideas out there, which is why we’ll also be asking you to share your own health and wellness tips this month. Tell us how you are contributing to a healthier future by leaving a comment on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/healthcaregov"><strong>Facebook page</strong></a> or by sending a tweet to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/healthcaregov"><strong>@HealthCareGov</strong></a> with the hashtag #prevention. We’ll feature some of your ideas on our blog and social media websites to help inspire others.</p>
<p>In the end, we’re all responsible for our own health. But we know that when we work together to make healthy choices easier and more affordable, everyone benefits. So during <em>Prevention and Wellness Month</em>, you’ll also learn about business initiatives that help make the workplace a healthier environment. And you’ll hear about how we’re working across government to make health a priority in everything from transportation to housing policy.</p>
<p>Across the country, Americans are taking on today’s health challenges in exciting, innovative ways that recognize the value of preventing health problems before they occur. If we can build on and expand these prevention and wellness efforts, the payoff won’t just fewer health problems. It will be longer, richer lives to share with your friends and family, and a stronger, more prosperous, and a more competitive nation for all of us.</p>

      <p><em>By Jonathan Blum, Deputy Administrator and Director, Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid. Crosspost from </em><a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/seniors05242011.html"><em>Healthcare.gov</em></a></p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act is cutting the cost of prescription drugs for millions of people with Medicare. Starting this year, people with Medicare receive a 50% percent discount on covered brand name drugs bought when they are in the <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/donuthole.html">donut hole</a>.</p>
<p>To receive the discount, no special action is required. Seniors simply purchase drugs at the pharmacy and receive the discount automatically.</p>
<p>So far, 271,000 people have used the discounts to save an average of $613 for a total of $166 million. These savings will continue to grow.  Most people who reach the donut hole do so later in the year, so we know more and more seniors will be helped as the year progresses.  But seniors with high costs are already receiving critical relief from prescription drug costs.</p>
<p>Most of these discounts are helping seniors with serious medical conditions – nearly 20% of the benefits provided to date – more than $32 million – are for cancer drugs and another nearly 10% – about $16 million – are for drugs provide to multiple sclerosis patients. </p>
<p>Last year, Medicare provided immediate relief to seniors with high drug costs in the form of a one-time $250 rebate check for every person who fell into the donut hole.  Nearly 4 million seniors received checks to help defray the costs of prescription drugs.  This year that assistance has been expanded, and by the end of the decade - thanks to the health care law - the donut hole will be closed.</p>
<p>This is <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/2011medicarebenes.html">only part of</a> the help people with Medicare are getting this year.  Since January 1, people with Medicare may receive for an annual Wellness Visit with their doctor to make a plan to keep healthy  Also, all those with Medicare can receive recommended preventive care, including certain cancer screenings, for free.  All of these improvements to Medicare will help Americans with Medicare live longer, healthier lives.  That's the kind of good news we can all celebrate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/donuthole05242011a.html">Visit this page to see how many people</a> with Medicare have received discounts on their prescription drugs in your State – and the average and total discount amounts by State.</p>

      <p>Older Americans Month is an occasion to show appreciation and support for our seniors as they continue to enrich and strengthen our communities.</p>
<p>This year's theme—Older Americans: Connecting the Community—pays homage to the many ways in which older adults bring inspiration and continuity to the fabric of our communities, and highlights how technology is helping older Americans live longer, healthier, and more engaged lives.<br />
The U.S. Administration on Aging is sponsoring two exciting activities in observance of Older Americans Month 2011, a video challenge and a video game tournament. We welcome and encourage the participation of seniors and community members across the country.</p>
