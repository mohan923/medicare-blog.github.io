      <p>Medicare fraud affects everyone. You can team up with Medicare to help.</p>
<p>Our Senior Medicare Patrol volunteers are teaching people like you how to spot, report, and stop fraud, and protect themselves from identity theft.</p>
<p>Here are some things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers. <strong>Treat them like you would treat your credit cards</strong>.</li>
<li>Hang up the phone if someone calls and asks for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information. We will <strong>NEVER</strong> call and ask for this information, and we will <strong>NEVER</strong> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.</li>
<li>Be suspicious of anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number. <strong>It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!</strong></li>
<li>Do not let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare ID card or your identity.</li>
<li>Check your Medicare claims for errors. Look at your Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) or statements from your Medicare plan. You can also check <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">www.MyMedicare.gov </a>or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) as soon as your claims have been processed. The sooner you see and report errors, the sooner we can stop fraud. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.</li>
<li>Call 1-800-MEDICARE to report any suspected fraud.</li>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">As part of National Consumer Protection Week, the Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), Marilyn Tavenner, announced the redesign of the statement that informs Medicare beneficiaries about their claims for Medicare services and benefits.  The redesigned statement, known as the Medicare Summary Notice (MSN), will be available online and, starting in 2013, mailed out quarterly to beneficiaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">This MSN redesign is part of a new initiative, “Your Medicare Information: Clearer, Simpler, At Your Fingertips,” which aims to make Medicare information clearer, more accessible, and easier for beneficiaries and their caregivers to understand.  CMS will take additional actions this year to make information about benefits, providers, and claims more accessible and easier to understand for seniors and people with disabilities who have Medicare.  This MSN redesign reflects more than 18 months of research and feedback from beneficiaries to provide enhanced customer service and respond to suggestions and input.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">“Consumer protection starts with making sure consumers not only get timely and accurate information, but that they understand what services they’re receiving from Medicare,” said Acting Administrator Tavenner.  “The new Medicare Summary Notice empowers Medicare’s seniors and people with disabilities.  The statement is easier to understand and navigate, and makes clear what information to check and how to report potential fraud.  The new MSN also makes it easier for people with Medicare to understand their benefits and file appeals if a claim is denied.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">To see a side-by-side comparison of the former and redesigned MSNs, please visit:</span> <a href="http://www.cms.gov/apps/files/msn_changes.pdf"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">http://www.cms.gov/apps/files/msn_changes.pdf</span></a> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">The redesign of the MSN includes several features not currently available to Medicare beneficiaries with the current MSN:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">A clear notice on how to check the form for important facts and potential fraud;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">An easy-to-understand snapshot of the beneficiary’s deductible status, a list of providers they saw, and whether their claims for Medicare services were approved.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Clearer language, including consumer-friendly descriptions for medical procedures;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Definitions of all terms used in the form;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Larger fonts throughout to make it easier to read;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Information on preventive services available to Medicare beneficiaries.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Starting later this week, the redesigned MSN will be available to beneficiaries on mymedicare.gov, Medicare’s secure online service for personalized information regarding Medicare benefits and services; and, in early 2013, paper copies of the redesigned MSN will start to replace the current version being mailed.</span></p>

<p>Each day, you make decisions about your finances, health, privacy, and more. It’s important to protect yourself and make the best choices for you, especially when it comes to your Medicare.</p>
<p>During National Consumer Protection Week (NCPW), non-profit organizations and government agencies give people like you information on how to take advantage of your rights and make better-informed choices. At Medicare, we’re here to help you become an informed Medicare consumer. Here are 5 things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Know your rights. </strong>As a person with Medicare, you have certain <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11534.pdf">rights and protections</a> designed to help protect you and make sure you get the health care services the law says you can get.</li>
<li><strong>Protect your identity.</strong> Identity theft happens when someone uses your personal information without your consent to commit fraud or other crimes. Keep the following personal information safe:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>Your Social Security number</li>
<li>Your Medicare number (or your membership card if you’re in a Medicare Advantage or other Medicare health plan)</li>
<li>Your credit card and bank account numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>Get more information on how to <a href="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/preventfraud/index.html">protect yourself from identity theft</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Help fight Medicare fraud.</strong> Medicare fraud diverts money from the Medicare program each year, which means higher health care costs for you. Learn how to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/help-and-support/fraud-and-abuse/fraud-and-abuse-overview.aspx">spot and report fraud</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Get involved with other seniors with the Senior Medicare Patrol (SMP). </strong><a href="http://www.smpresource.org/">The SMP</a> educates and empowers people with Medicare to take an active role in detecting and preventing health care fraud and abuse.</li>
<li><strong>Make informed Medicare choices. </strong>Each year during the fall Open Enrollment Period (October 15-December 7), review your plan to make sure it’s going to meet your needs for the following year. If you’re not satisfied with your current plan, you can switch during the Open Enrollment Period.<strong></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.ncpw.gov/">NCPW</a> to learn more about the campaign, see which agencies and organizations are able to help you, and to find out if there are any NCPW activities happening in your area.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><em>By Marilyn Tavenner, Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)</em></p>
<p>Fighting fraud and waste in the health care system is a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/02/14/obama-administration-s-unprecedented-fraud-fighting-pays">top priority for the Obama Administration</a>.  We are committed to using all resources at our disposal in these efforts – and they are paying off.</p>
<p>Just last week, the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services (HHS) <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/hcfac/index.asp">released an updated annual report</a> showing that in FY 2011 anti-fraud efforts have recovered more than $4.1 billion in fraudulent Medicare payments – the second year in a row recovery efforts reached this unprecedented level.  Compare this to just $2.14 billion recovered in FY 2008.  Prosecutions are way up too:  the number of individuals charged with fraud increased from 821 in fiscal year 2008 to 1,430 in fiscal year 2011 – nearly a 75 percent increase.</p>
<p>But we know we need keep doing more to end the “pay and chase” model of fighting fraud.  We need to stop fraud and waste from happening in the first place.  Today we’re taking an important step to protect taxpayer dollars by reducing improper payments to Medicare Advantage plans, an action that is estimated to save $370 million in the first audit year alone.  By improving the way we audit Medicare Advantage contracts, we will reduce the payment error rate for the Medicare Advantage program  and that saves money for Medicare.</p>
<p>We are also using new, advanced techniques to fight fraud.  Starting last year, we have been using “predictive modeling” technology – similar to technology used by credit card companies to identify and fight fraud nationwide.  This effort is just getting started but it’s already making a difference. Since the predictive modeling system was activated, CMS has stopped, prevented or identified $20 million in payments through November 2011 that should not have been made.</p>
<p>In addition, predictive modeling has identified 2,500 leads for further investigation, 600 preliminary law enforcement cases under review and resulted in 400 direct interviews with providers who would not have otherwise been contacted.</p>
<p>Predictive modeling won’t reach its full potential in overnight, but it’s already making an incredible difference and will do even more in the weeks, months and years ahead.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced today that the Affordable Care Act provided approximately 54 million Americans with at least one new free preventive service in 2011 through their private health insurance plans. Secretary Sebelius also announced that an estimated 32.5 million people with Medicare received at least one free preventive benefit in 2011, including the new Annual Wellness Visit, since the health reform law was enacted.</p>
<p>Together, this means an estimated 86 million Americans were helped by health reform’s prevention coverage improvements. The new data were released in two new reports from HHS.</p>
<p>“Americans of all ages can now get the preventive services they need, like mammograms and the new Annual Wellness Visit, free of charge, as a result of the new health care law,” Secretary Sebelius said. “With more people taking advantage of these benefits, more lives can be saved, and costly, and often burdensome, diseases can be prevented or caught earlier.”</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act requires many insurance plans to provide coverage without cost sharing to enrollees for a variety of preventive health services, such as colonoscopy screening for colon cancer, Pap smears and mammograms for women, well-child visits, and flu shots for all children and adults. The law also makes proven preventive services free for most people on Medicare.</p>
<p>The report on private health insurance coverage also examined the expansion of free preventive services in minority populations.  The results showed that an estimated 6.1 million Latinos, 5.5 million Blacks, 2.7 million Asian Americans and 300,000 Native Americans with private insurance received expanded preventive benefits coverage in 2011 as a result of the new health care law.</p>
<p>The report discussing Medicare preventive services found that more than 25.7 million Americans in traditional Medicare received free preventive services in 2011. The report also looked at Medicare Advantage plans and found that 9.3 million Americans – 97 percent of those in individual Medicare Advantage plans – were enrolled in a plan that offered free preventive services.  Assuming that people in Medicare Advantage plans utilized preventive services at the same rate as those with traditional Medicare, an estimated 32.5 million people benefited from Medicare’s coverage of prevention with no cost sharing.</p>
<p>The full report on expanded preventive benefits in private health insurance is available at <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2012/PreventiveServices/ib.shtml">http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2012/PreventiveServices/ib.shtml</a>.  The report on expanded preventive benefits in Medicare and other ways that the Affordable Care Act strengthens Medicare is available at <a href="http://www.cms.gov/newsroom/">http://www.cms.gov/newsroom/</a>.</p>
