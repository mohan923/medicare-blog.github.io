      <p><em>by Kathleen Sebelius</em></p>
<p>If you’ve had a Medicare Advantage or Prescription Drug Plan for a few years, you’ll know that December is the end of Medicare Open Enrollment.  This year, the last day for you to choose new Medicare health or prescription drug coverage for 2012 is December 7, earlier than it’s been in previous years.</p>
<p>December 7 is tomorrow.  But you still have until midnight tomorrow if you want to make a change  to your medical or prescription drug coverage.</p>
<p>And as you are reviewing your plan, remember that Medicare is only getting stronger. New data released today shows how millions of seniors have gotten cheaper prescription drugs and free preventive services, all thanks to the President’s health reform law.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap known as the donut hole is starting to close. Through the end of October, 2.65 million people with Medicare have received discounts on brand name drugs in the donut hole.  These discounts have saved seniors and people with disabilities a total of $1.5 billion on prescriptions – averaging about $569 per person.  For State-by-State information on the number of people who are benefiting from this discount in 2011, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Plan-Payment/">visit this page</a>.</p>
<p>Over the coming years, the Affordable Care Act will help close the coverage gap completely. Each year from now to 2020, you’ll pay less for brand name and generic drugs in the coverage gap.  And in 2020, the coverage gap will be eliminated and the donut hole will be closed for good.</p>
<p>In addition to cheaper prescription drugs, the Affordable Care Act also made preventive services available to people with Medicare for free. Preventive care helps people stay healthy and live longer lives. Through the end of November nearly 24.2 million people with Medicare have received one or more free preventive services, including Medicare’s new free Annual Wellness Visit.  For State-by-State information on the numbers of people who are utilizing preventive services in 2011, <a href="http://www.cms.gov/NewMedia/02_preventive.asp">visit this page.</a></p>
<p>These new benefits are just two ways the Affordable Care Act is making Medicare and our health care system stronger and giving hardworking families the security they deserve. It has helped lower your Part B premium in 2012 by $22.  And, on average, Medicare Advantage premiums will be lower in 2012 as enrollment continues to rise.</p>
<p>And if you haven’t reviewed your Medicare coverage, take time now to compare your current coverage with other options to make sure your plan will meet your health care needs for the coming year.  Medicare now offers better choices, more benefits, and lower costs thanks to the Affordable Care Act.

      <p><em>by Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services</em></p>
<p>With housework, doctor appointments, time with family, and job responsibilities, there are always tasks that get left until the last minute. But whether I’m choosing an insurance plan or planning a vacation, I still want to make sure my “I”s are dotted and my “T”s crossed. I want to know that everything’s taken care of – without worry and confusion.</p>
<p>Speaking of insurance, time is running out! If you’ve been thinking about changing your Medicare coverage, the time to act is now. The dates for Medicare Open Enrollment are early this year to allow for a smoother transition to a new plan.  Not only did Open Enrollment start earlier, but it also ends earlier - the last day for you to change your Medicare plan is now December 7.  This gives Medicare enough time to process any change you may make and have you linked correctly to the plan you choose as soon as your coverage starts. That way you can go to the doctor or your pharmacy on January 1 without having to worry about your coverage.   </p>
<p>If you’re like me, you might use the December holidays to discuss health care options with family or friends. I use the time to talk to my father, who is on Medicare. This year, because Medicare Open Enrollment ends early, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVAPT3m3BZg&amp;feature=player_profilepage">the time to have that important conversation is now</a>.</p>
<p>This year, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, you have better <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/"> choices, more benefits and lower costs</a>, and it’s worth it to review them. Our counselors worked with a man in Oregon who has saved more than $600 a month on his prescription drugs between benefits from the health care law and lowering his doses.  $600 a month makes a huge difference in helping him pay other bills, and still put some money into savings.</p>
<p>I know that sorting through your health and drug coverage choices during <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Open Enrollment</a> can be confusing but you don’t have to do it alone. </p>
<p>Look around for <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/11/medicare-open-enrollment-4-places-to-look-for-medicare-information/">all the Medicare information out there</a>. We have plenty of resources to help you think about <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/17/medicare-open-enrollment-things-to-think-about-when-comparing-plans/">cost, coverage, extra benefits, and convenience</a> when evaluating your plan choices. And visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Open Enrollment center</a>, where we’ve gathered everything you need online, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQQJ7ry_H6k">including a video on how the Medicare Plan Finder works</a>, to walk through your options. </p>
<p>Medicare’s here to help you, stronger than ever. Take the time this week to review and compare plans. It’s worth it - you can relax later.</p>

      <p><em>By Nancy-Ann DeParle. Crosspost from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/11/28/millions-seniors-saving-money-prescription-drugs-thanks-affordable-care-act">The White House Blog</a></em></p>
<p>Over the weekend, a <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MEDICARE_COVERAGE_GAP?SITE=WVEC&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">report by the Associated Press </a>detailed how the Affordable Care Act is dramatically reducing drug costs for seniors who hit the prescription drug coverage gap known as the donut hole. This year, seniors are benefiting from a 50 percent discount on brand-name drugs in the donut hole. And the discount and other provisions in the law are saving money for seniors. As the AP reported:</p>
<p>The average beneficiary who falls into the coverage gap would have spent $1,504 this year on prescriptions. But thanks to discounts and other provisions in President Barack Obama's health care overhaul law, that cost fell to $901, according to Medicare's Office of the Actuary, which handles economic estimates.</p>
<p>So far this year, more than 2.2 million people with Medicare have saved more than $1.2 billion on their prescriptions. The Associated Press spoke with two of them:</p>
<p>For retired elementary school teacher Carolyn Friedman, it meant she didn't need a loan to pay for drugs that keep her epilepsy under control.</p>
<p>"What a change for the better," said Friedman, 71, of Sunrise, Fla. "This year it was easier to pay my bills, whereas last year I had to borrow money to pay for my medications when I was in the doughnut hole."</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Joan Gibbs thought her pharmacy had made a mistake. Her total cost for a brand-name painkiller in the doughnut hole came out lower than her co-payment earlier in the year, at a time her plan was picking up most of the tab.</p>
<p>"I reluctantly called the insurance company," said Gibbs, 54, who lives near Cleveland. "If they had made a mistake, I knew they would catch it sooner or later. I was very surprised that it turned out to be such a good discount."</p>
<p>Gibbs is on Medicare because of an auto-immune disorder and other medical problems that left her unable to work.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, seniors will receive bigger discounts in the years ahead. By 2020, the donut hole will be closed completely.</p>
<p>And even if you don’t hit the donut hole, there’s still good news for beneficiaries with Medicare Part D.  Prescription drug premiums <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/08/20110804a.html">will not rise next year</a>, and thanks to health reform, seniors can get preventive services like mammograms and other cancer screenings for free.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><em>By Jonathan Blum, Deputy Administrator and Director for the Center for Medicare</em></p>
<p>Have you ever gotten a great deal to try a new restaurant or dry cleaner, only to realize that it just wasn’t worth the hassle? Maybe it was on the other side of town, or the hours weren’t convenient, or there were too many exceptions.  We all like to get a good deal, but convenience is a big part of the value.</p>
<p>The same is true when it comes to choosing a health plan: convenience matters. So in addition to <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/11/01/medicare-open-enrollment-looking-at-costs/"><span style="color:#800080;">cost</span></a>, <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/11/22/medicare-open-enrollment-3-cs-for-thanksgiving-dinner/"><span style="color:#800080;">coverage</span></a>, and <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/11/15/medicare-open-enrollment-extra-benefits-preventive-services/"><span style="color:#800080;">benefits</span></a>, here are some other things you may want to consider as you compare Medicare options this year:</p>
<p><strong>Doctor and hospital choice</strong><br />
You want to be comfortable with the people you’re working with, especially when it comes to something as private as your health. Do the doctors you know accept your coverage? Where are the doctors’ offices? What are their hours? Do they often keep you waiting?</p>
<p><strong>Pharmacy access</strong><br />
Is the pharmacy you use included in your drug plan’s network?  Do they use e-prescribing? Can you get refills by mail? Remember that plan networks can change from year to year. If it’s important to you to stay with the same  pharmacy, it’s worth checking to make sure they’ll still be in your plan’s network.</p>
<p><strong>Travel</strong><br />
Maybe you travel a lot, or spend part of the year in a different state. If you do, make sure you know whether your coverage will travel with you.</p>
<p><strong>Quality</strong><br />
Ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. Look for plans with a 5‑star performance rating — the right expertise and care may help speed your recovery and improve your outcomes.</p>
<p>Your time is valuable — and so is your health. The health care law brought <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/">more benefits and better choice</a> to the Medicare program, but only you know what mix of coverage and convenience is most important to you and your family.</p>
<p>That’s why we’re working hard to make sure you have choice and control over the Medicare benefits you’ve earned.  Look around for <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/11/medicare-open-enrollment-4-places-to-look-for-medicare-information/">all the Medicare information out there</a>.  And visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Open Enrollment center</a>, where we’ve gathered everything you need, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQQJ7ry_H6k">including a video on how the Medicare Plan Finder works</a>, to walk through your options.</p>
