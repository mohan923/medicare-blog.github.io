<ol>
<li>Guard your information.</li>
<li>Be wary of giveaways.</li>
<li>Don’t lend your identity.</li>
<li>If you spot something, say something</li>
</ol>
<p>These are 4 simple ways to protect your identity and personal information from Medicare fraud, but they can be difficult to do if you’re caught off guard. </p>
<p>During Medicare Open Enrollment - between now and December 7 - you can expect to hear a lot about the <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/"><span style="color:#003399;">choices, benefits, and lower costs</span></a> you have when it comes to Medicare.</p>
<p>Open Enrollment is a great time for you to review and compare your Medicare choices and make you have the coverage that fits your needs. Unfortunately, it’s also a popular time for Medicare fraud schemes. </p>
<p>During Open Enrollment, you’ll find Medicare information all around you <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/11/medicare-open-enrollment-4-places-to-look-for-medicare-information/"><span style="color:#003399;">– in the mail, on TV, in the paper, and on your computer</span></a>.  Here are a few reminders to keep you safe from those who might not have your best interests in mind:    </p>
<p><strong>1.    </strong><strong>Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers – treat them like you’d treat your credit cards. </strong></p>
<p>You’ll be hearing so much about Medicare during Open Enrollment, that it may not surprise you to get phone calls or visits to your house from people selling Medicare plans. </p>
<p>It’s illegal for someone to call and ask for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information.  A Medicare representative or a private insurance plan working with Medicare will <strong>never</strong> call and ask for this information, and we will <strong>never</strong> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.  If a sales agent does call or visit you uninvited they are violating the Medicare marketing rules.</p>
<p><strong>2.    Be suspicious of people offering free medical equipment or services.</strong></p>
<p> Anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number is tricking you – if it’s really free, they don’t need your Medicare number. It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!</p>
<p><strong>3.    </strong><strong>Don’t let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare card or your personal information.</strong></p>
<p>If someone asks you for your Medicare number, stop and think. If you wouldn’t feel comfortable giving that person your credit card number, <strong>don’t</strong> give them your Medicare number. </p>
<p><strong>4.   Most importantly, if you suspect Medicare fraud, let us know!</strong> Call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227).</p>
<p>Medicare is stronger than ever, and we need your help to keep it that way. The health care law is doing a lot to help us fight Medicare fraud and make America stronger, safer, and healthier. </p>

Learn more about spotting and reporting fraud, and learn about our Senior Medicare Patrol volunteers who are teaching people like you how to spot, report, and stop fraud, and protect themselves from identity theft.</p>
<p>Remember, a little preparation goes a long way. If you experience a Medicare fraud scheme - walk away, hang up, close the door, or say “no thanks.”</p>

<p>Cross-posted from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/10/deliveryreform10202011.html">HealthCare.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Posted October 20, 2011</p>
<p>Your doctors try hard to give you the best care possible, but it can be a challenge to get all the information they need to protect your health.  For people with Medicare, this is particularly important because a significant number of people over age 65 and those with disabilities live with one or more chronic conditions. That is why I’m so pleased with the work we are doing with doctors and hospitals to find ways to improve care and reduce costs.</p>
<p>When doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers are able to work together they provide better, more coordinated health care. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, they can do that by becoming an Accountable Care Organization (ACO)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>By taking this step, providers will be able to communicate closely with each other about your health with the goal of delivering better and more coordinated care while meeting your needs and preferences. Doctors will be able to spend more time with patients. And specialists and primary care doctors will communicate more to ensure that you get the care you need.</p>
<p>Medicare will help doctors and hospitals that choose to participate ensure you are getting the right care, in the right place, at the right time.  And if that care coordination lowers costs, doctors and hospitals as well as Medicare can share in the savings – shifting payments toward value rather than volume of care.</p>
<p>Your Medicare benefits will stay the same. You can see still see any doctor or healthcare provider who accepts Medicare – even if your doctor chooses to participate in this program. Nobody – not your doctor, not anyone – can limit your choice on who you see.</p>
<p>If your provider decides to participate, you will be notified. For more information, talk to your doctor or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-8227). TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.</p>
<p>This is just one of many ways the Affordable Care Act is helping your doctors spend more time with you to help you to stay healthy and to get better.  Learn more <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/10/deliveryreform10172011.html">here</a>.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><em>By Jonathan Blum, Deputy Administrator for Medicare</em></p>
<p>Every day we are faced with choices.  We check the weather forecast to help us decide what to wear.  We might look over the supermarket sale ad to help us figure out what to have for dinner.  I’ll bet that sometime today, without even realizing it, you’re going to gather some information and use it to help you make a decision.  Some of those choices might be harder than others.</p>
<p>In my work with the Medicare program, I know that choices are a good thing.  But I’m also aware – because some of you have told me -- that sorting through your health and drug coverage choices during <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Open Enrollment</a> can be confusing — especially when many Medicare plans seem to offer similar benefits.</p>
<p>That’s why making Medicare easier to access has been one of our top priorities. The Affordable Care Act is helping us do this, in addition to delivering <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/">better choices, more benefits, and lower overall costs</a> to the Medicare program.</p>
<p>We’ve been working to make Medicare less confusing by steadily phasing out duplicative plans, and shoring up our website, toll-free call center and community programs to make it easier for people to find Medicare coverage that works for them.</p>
<p>This year, when you sit down to review your Medicare health and drug plan choices, here are some things I hope you think about:</p>
<p><strong>Are the services you need covered?</strong></p>
<p>We know future health care needs can be hard to predict, but changes happen. Maybe your family situation is different this year, or you have different health concerns. Make sure you understand what services and benefits you’re likely to use in the coming year.</p>
<p>Remember that no matter what plan you pick, you’ll have access to a <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/65-older/medicare-preventive-services/index.html">variety of preventive tests and screenings, at no cost to you</a>, thanks to the health care law.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any other coverage?</strong></p>
<p>You may have other health insurance from a current or past job, or through a family member.  If you do, you’ll want to understand exactly how that other coverage works with Medicare. You may want to just keep what you have.</p>
<p><strong>Costs</strong></p>
<p>How much are your premiums and deductibles? How much do you pay for hospital stays and doctor visits? Is it important for you to have expenses balanced throughout the year?  Just like with everything else, the lowest-cost health plan option might not be the best choice for you.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor and hospital choice</strong></p>
<p>We understand the relationships you have with your doctors and providers are important. Do your doctors accept your coverage? Do you have to choose your hospital from a network? Do you need to get referrals?  With Original Medicare, you can always go to any doctor or hospital that accepts new Medicare patients.</p>
<p><strong>Drug coverage</strong></p>
<p>Do you need to join a Medicare drug plan? Will you pay a penalty if you join a drug plan later? How much will your prescriptions cost under each plan? Even if you don’t take many drugs now, you might want the peace of mind of knowing you’re covered.</p>
<p><strong>Quality of care</strong></p>
<p>Ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. Look for plans with a 5‑star performance rating — the right expertise and care may help speed your recovery and improve your outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Convenience</strong></p>
<p>Your time is valuable, too. Where are the doctors’ offices? What are their hours? Which pharmacies can you use? Can you get prescriptions by mail? Do the doctors use electronic health records or prescribe electronically? Remember that even if you are happy with your current plan, these answers might change from year to year.</p>
<p><strong>Travel plans</strong></p>
<p>Maybe you travel a lot, or spend part of the year in a different state. If you do, make sure you know whether your coverage will travel with you.</p>
<p>Only you know what’s most important to you and your family – that’s why we want to make sure you have all the information you need to make the best decision for you.  Look around for all the Medicare information out there [link to second blog in series]. And visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Open Enrollment center</a>, where we’ve gathered everything you need to walk through your options.  Now, what’s for dinner?</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><em>By Julie Green Bataille, Director of Communications </em></p>
<p>Whether it’s apple picking or Sunday afternoon football, there’s a comfort in things that happen every fall. Shorter days and cooler nights also mark the start of Medicare Open Enrollment. Between now and December 7, you can expect to hear about the <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/">choices, benefits, and lower overall costs</a> you have when it comes to Medicare - many of them thanks to the health care law.</p>
<p>Open Enrollment is your chance to review your health care coverage and see if you need to make any changes, or if you are happy sticking with the plan you have.  The health care law extended the Open Enrollment period and made it earlier – giving you more time to make choices and giving Medicare time to process everything so your coverage starts without a hitch on January 1<sup>st</sup>.This year, you can make any changes as early as October 15.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Over the next few months, look around – you’ll find a wealth of information about your Medicare benefits.  Our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Medicare Open Enrollment calendar</a> tells you what to look for this fall, especially in these 4 everyday places:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your mailbox<br />
</strong>Look through your mail carefully — you may get important notices from your current plan, Medicare, or Social Security about changes to your coverage or any extra help you may get paying for prescription drugs.Also look for your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/">Medicare &amp; You</a> handbook.  Like an old friend, it shows up around the same time every year. This year, it may be in your email inbox instead – if you decide to “go green” and asked to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Library/PDFNavigation/PDFInterim.asp?Language=English&amp;Type=Pub&amp;PubID=10050">get it electronically</a>. But whether it’s on your computer or on your bookshelf, now is the time to take it out and find out what’s new in Medicare.</p>
<p>You’ll also start to see brochures from companies that offer Medicare health and drug plans. Just remember, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/help-and-support/fraud-and-abuse/fraud-and-abuse-overview.aspx">be smart about protecting your personal information and your identity</a> — plans aren’t allowed to call or come to your home without an invitation from <strong>you</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>On your computer<br />
</strong>Comparing your plan choices is important –and our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> makes it as simple as possible. Soon, you’ll be able to watch a video about how the Plan Finder works. Enter the drugs you take to find out how you can lower your costs, review a the plan’s <a href="http://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">star ratings</a> to compare plans based on quality, and join a plan right online if you find one that meets your needs.</li>
<li><strong>In newspaper, newsletters, and magazines<br />
</strong>Take a moment as you enjoy that morning coffee to read the Medicare information that’s out there.  You may find a local event — somewhere right around the corner with counselors to help you, like your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/contacts">State Health Insurance Assistance Program</a>. Don’t miss the chance to get personalized help if you need it.</li>
<li><strong>On television and radio<br />
</strong>At the end of one of those shorter days, as you relax in front of the television, you may see some advertisements or programming about Medicare plans and your new choices.  You might also hear some advertisements on your way to or from work as you listen to the radio.Now is the time to enjoy the choice and control you have over your health care coverage. Just like fall, Medicare Open Enrollment only comes once a year.</li>
