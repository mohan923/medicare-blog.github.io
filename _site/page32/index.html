<p>Millions of Americans are enjoying improved Medicare coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act. More people are getting preventive services to keep them healthy, and people with high prescription drug costs are seeing the <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/donuthole.html">coverage gap</a> “donut hole” starting to close. Here are the latest numbers from the past few months:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>July:</strong>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Through the end of July, 1.28 million Americans with Medicare have received discounts on brand name drugs in the Medicare Part D coverage gap — up from 899,000 through the end of June and 478,000 through the end of May.</li>
<li>These discounts have saved seniors and people with disabilities a total of$660 million, including $199 million in July alone!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For state-by-state information on the number of people who are benefiting from this discount in 2011, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Plan-Payment/">visit this page</a>.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>August:</strong>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Through the end of August, over 18.9 million people with Original Medicare, or 55.6 percent, have received one or more free preventive services.</li>
<li>During the same time period, over 1.2 million Americans with Original Medicare have taken advantage of Medicare’s new free Annual Wellness Visit, up from 1.06 million in July.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For state-by-state information on the numbers of people who are utilizing preventive services in 2011, <a href="http://www.cms.gov/NewMedia/02_preventive.asp">visit this page.</a></p>
<p>Over the coming years, provisions of the Affordable Care Act will help close the coverage gap completely. Here is a sense of what people with Medicare can look forward to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>2013:</strong> Paying less and less for your brand-name Part D prescription drugs in the coverage gap.</li>
<li><strong>2020:</strong> The coverage gap will be closed, meaning there will be no more “donut hole,” and people with Medicare will pay only 25% of the costs of their drugs until they reach the yearly out-of-pocket spending limit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chart below shows what people with Medicare prescription coverage will pay over time:</p>

      <p>Pencils, backpack, lunch box? All covered. How about health insurance?</p>
<p>If you’re one of the millions of hard-working families without health insurance, there’s great news: the <a href="http://www.insurekidsnow.gov/"><strong>Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)</strong></a> covers more kids than ever. CHIP offers low-cost or free health insurance for babies, children, and teens, even if you’re working or you’ve been turned down by state programs before.</p>
<p>CHIP pays for doctor visits, prescriptions, and hospitalizations. Most states also cover dental care, eye care, and medical equipment. What you pay depends on your state and your income, but many services are free, and charges for others are small.</p>
<p><strong>Protect Your Child’s Health &amp; Future</strong></p>
<p>With coverage through CHIP, you can see a doctor when your child gets sick, without having to worry about how you’ll pay for it. Your kids can get the shots and well-child visits they need to attend school and play sports. </p>
<p>The fact is, children with health insurance are more likely to be healthier and miss fewer school days. When they do get sick, you won't have to sit for hours in the emergency room for conditions that could be easily treated in your doctor's office. </p>
<p><strong>Applying for CHIP Is Easy &amp; Free</strong></p>
<p>In most states, you can complete a short application through the mail or over the phone. Visit <a href="http://www.insurekidsnow.gov/"><strong>insurekidsnow.gov</strong></a>, or make a free call to <strong>1-877-KIDS-NOW (1-877-543-7669).  </strong></p>
<p>Many families think they make too much money to qualify, but you’d be surprised. If you’re a grandparent or legal guardian, many states also let you apply for the children in your care.</p>

      <p>Medicare fraud affects everyone. You can team up with Medicare to help.</p>
<p>Our Senior Medicare Patrol volunteers are teaching people like you how to spot, report, and stop fraud, and protect themselves from identity theft. </p>
<p>Here are some things you can do:</p>
<p>•	Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers. <strong>Treat them like you would treat your credit cards</strong>. </p>
<p>•	Hang up the phone if someone calls and asks for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information. We will <strong>NEVER</strong> call and ask for this information, and we will <strong>NEVER</strong> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.</p>
<p>•	Be suspicious of anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number. <strong>It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!</strong> </p>
<p>•	Do not let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare ID card or your identity.</p>
<p>•	Check your Medicare claims for errors. Look at your Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) or statements from your Medicare plan. You can also check <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">www.MyMedicare.gov </a>or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) as soon as your claims have been processed. The sooner you see and report errors, the sooner we can stop fraud.</p>
<p>•	Call 1-800-MEDICARE to report any suspected fraud. TTY users should call<br />
1-877-486-2048.</p>
<p>Medicare is cracking down on fraud, and so can you. </p>
<p>•	<a href="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/">Learn more </a>about spotting and reporting fraud, and get tips on protecting yourself from identity theft.<br />
•	Find out about <a href="http://www.smpresource.org/">Senior Medicare Patrol </a>activities in your area.</p>

      <p><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">Do you know about the “Beneficio Adicional” or “Extra Help” program? My mother always told me if you wanted to know anything, you went to “la plaza del pueblo” (town square).  You went to socialize with neighbors, exchange important news, pass “chisme” (gossip) and take part in the community. The plaza was all about conversation and learning from one another what’s really happening in the world. We may have left the plaza behind, but the tradition of sharing information is as vital as ever. Blogs, IM, chat and social media are now our plaza. So here is some important information you might want to pass on. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">Many people with limited income and resources may qualify for Medicare’s “Extra Help” program, but they must apply to find out. You could be one of them. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">You can get help with Part D prescription drug coverage premiums, deductibles and co-payments. This means you don’t have to go without medications because you can’t afford them. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">It’s easy and free to apply for “Extra Help.”  </span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Visit Social Security’s </span><a href="http://www.segurosocial.gov/beneficioadicional"><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">Web site</span></span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;"> (in Spanish or English) to apply online or for more information.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 to apply over the phone or request an application (TTY users should call 1-800-325-0778). </span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Apply at your local </span><a href="http://www.segurosocial.gov/"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Social Security</span></a><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;"> office.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Save money, live well, and share the information, because this program is too important to keep to yourself.</span></span></p>

      <p>The health care providers and facilities you choose can affect your health – finding the right expertise and specialists may speed your recovery and improve how well your treatment works. We’ve just updated <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/home.asp">Nursing Home Compare</a> and the <a href="http://www.hospitalcompare.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Hospital Compare</a> with more information to help you compare health care facilities. And our new <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/qualitycarefinder">Quality Care Finder</a> is updated regularly to provide you with an easy way to search for health care professionals, services, and facilities.</p>
<p>Use these resources to make informed decisions about which facilities you choose:<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Nursing Homes</strong><br />
Medicare’s <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/NHCompare/home.asp">Nursing Home Compare</a> now has information about:</p>
<p>-          Nursing home health inspections and what happens after a facility is inspected</p>
<p>-          Complaints filed about a nursing home in the last 3 years</p>
<p>-          Incidents that a nursing home self-reported in the last 3 years</p>
<p>-          Enforcements, which are monetary penalties and denials of payments, that a nursing home received in the last 3 years</p>
<p>This information, along with the existing measures including quality of care and staffing, can help you compare the care you’ll get at different nursing homes and the specialties they offer. You can now read complaints filed at each nursing home, and find out how they affected residents’ care. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/nursing/checklist.pdf">Nursing Home Checklist</a> to track information about different nursing homes you visit.</p>
<p><strong>VA Hospitals</strong><br />
The <a href="http://www.hospitalcompare.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Hospital Compare</a> helps Veterans compare the quality of care at VA hospitals based on:</p>
<p>-          Reducing preventable surgical complications (part of the Surgical Care Improvement Project) including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infections</li>
<li>Blood clots</li>
<li>Heart (cardiac) problems</li>
<li>Breathing (respiratory) problems</li>
</ul>
<p>-          Measures about death (mortality) rates, readmissions to the hospital, and best treatments for these medical conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Congestive Heart Failure</li>
<li>Heart Attack</li>
<li>Pneumonia</li>
</ul>
