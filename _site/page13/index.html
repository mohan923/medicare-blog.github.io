      <p>Did you ever put off doing a task or getting a test and later wished you’d just gotten it over with? If you’re a man with Medicare, now’s the time to talk with your doctor about whether you should get screened for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/prostate-cancer-screening.aspx">prostate cancer</a>, for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/colorectal-cancer-screenings.html">colorectal cancer</a>, or for both. Screening tests can find cancer early, when treatment works best.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about the cost—if you’re a man 50 or over, Medicare covers a digital rectal exam and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test once every 12 month. Also, Medicare covers a variety of colorectal cancer screenings, and you pay nothing for most tests.</p>
<p>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, second only to lung cancer in the number of cancer deaths. Not sure you should get screened? You’re at a higher risk for getting prostate cancer if you’re a man 50 or older, are African-American, or have a father, brother, or son who has had prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Colorectal cancer is also common among men—in fact, it’s the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States among cancers that affect both men <i>and</i> women. If everyone 50 or older got screened regularly, we could avoid as many as 60% of deaths from this cancer.</p>
<p>In most cases, colorectal cancer develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Fortunately, screening tests can find these polyps, so you can get them removed before they turn into cancer. If you’re 50 or older, or have a personal or family history of colorectal issues, make sure you get screened regularly for colorectal cancer.</p>
<p>June is Men’s Health Month, a perfect time for you (and the men in your life) to take the steps to live a safer, healthier life. Watch our videos on how Medicare has you covered on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcM0wptOIJg">prostate cancer</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HPJp3VYdfg">colorectal cancer</a> screenings, and visit the Centers for Disease Control for more information on <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Features/HealthyMen/">men’s health</a>.</p>

      <p>If you’re planning a vacation this summer, you know there’s a lot to do before your leave – like buy sunscreen, book your flight, and renew your passport. Don’t forget to include 2 very important items on your travel to-do list if you plan to leave the country on your trip:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look into Medicare coverage outside the United States.</li>
<li>Think about getting additional health care coverage.</li>
</ol>
<p>You have Medicare, so your health care services and supplies are covered when you’re in the U.S., which includes Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. But, if you plan to travel overseas or outside the U.S. (including to Canada or Mexico), it’s important to know if your Medicare coverage will be different.</p>
<p>In most cases, Medicare won’t pay for health care services or supplies you get outside the U.S. Medicare may pay for health care and services you get outside the U.S. <a href="http://medicare.gov/coverage/travel-need-health-care-outside-us.html">in these rare cases</a>.</p>
<p>Because Medicare coverage outside the U.S. is limited, you may want to buy a travel insurance policy. To find out more about these policies, talk to an insurance or travel agent. Not all travel policies include health insurance, so ask questions and read the terms and conditions carefully.</p>
<p>Figuring out your health care coverage will help you be prepared so you can have a stress-free trip. To be even more prepared for your vacation, visit the Centers for Disease Control’s <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/">Traveler’s Health page</a> for more information on how to stay healthy abroad.</p>

      <p>This year include tobacco in your annual spring cleaning, and kick those cigarette butts in the, well, butt!  Why? Because tobacco use is the second leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for 1 in every 10 adult deaths. If you or someone you love is ready to quit smoking, we can help.</p>
<p><b>Medicare can help you quit smoking</b></p>
<p>Part B covers free counseling sessions as a preventive service to help you <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/smoking-cessation.aspx">quit smoking</a>. If you haven't been diagnosed with an illness caused or complicated by tobacco use, and if the doctor or other health care provider accepts assignment, then you pay nothing for the counseling sessions.</p>
<p>If you’ve already been diagnosed with an illness that was caused or made worse by tobacco use, or you take a medicine affected by tobacco, you can still get up to 8 counseling sessions every 12 months. In this case, you pay your Part B deductible and 20% of the Medicare-approved amount. (If you get counseling in a hospital outpatient setting, you’ll also need to pay the hospital a copayment.)</p>
<p><b>Let’s get started!</b></p>
<p>Bring out the trash bags and the brooms – it’s time for a clean start this spring. Visit the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/">Centers for Disease Control</a> and the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/tobacco/smoking">National Cancer Institute</a> to learn more about how you can quit smoking.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:18pt;background:white;"><span style="color:#111111;">By Jonathan Blum, Acting Principal Deputy Administrator and Director, Center for Medicare</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%;">With today’s regulation limiting overhead and profits for Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans, the Affordable Care Act continues to promote value for consumers’ and taxpayers’ health care spending. These new requirements apply to Medicare health and drug plans offered by private insurance companies serving over 37 million seniors and persons with disabilities, and build on a similar regulation we issued last year requiring a minimum medical loss ratio for health plans serving consumers in the private insurance market. Medicare health and drug plans, beginning next year, must meet a minimum medical loss ratio, limiting their spending on non-health related items such as administrative costs, profit, or overhead. More specifically, this means that the plans must spend at least 85 percent of their revenue on direct benefits to Medicare enrollees such as clinical services, prescription drugs and quality improving activities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%;">The new Medicare MLR requirements will also give people with Medicare and their caregivers more information about Medicare plans when comparing their health care options during enrollment periods. They will be able to consider a plan’s medical loss ratio, along with quality ratings, coverage, premiums and other factors that influence their health care decisions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%;">By ensuring that plan payments are spent on health care and activities that improve the quality of care received, seniors and persons with disabilities will have more opportunities to work with their doctors and other health care professionals to stay healthy. With Medicare spending already growing at a slower pace, the new requirements are just one more way the Affordable Care Act is creating more value for seniors and persons with disabilities. We are excited about new initiatives and projects that are improving the health of people with Medicare and are committed to making a stronger Medicare program.</p>
