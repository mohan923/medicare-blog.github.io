<p>Fighting Medicare fraud has long been a top priority for President Obama. Today, we are releasing a new infographic that describes how the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/healthreform">Affordable Care Act</a> – the new health care law – is helping the Obama Administration crack down on Medicare fraud and make Medicare stronger. The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infographics/medicare-fraud-0512">new infographic</a> shows how the law increases penalties for criminals who commit fraud and provides new enforcement tools to stop fraud and save taxpayers money. </p>
<p>We are committed to using these new tools to fight Medicare and other health care fraud, and we are getting results:  The Administration’s anti-fraud efforts recovered $4.1 billion in taxpayer dollars last year, the second year recoveries hit this record-breaking level. Total recoveries over the last three years were $10.7 billion. Prosecutions are way up, too: the number of individuals charged with fraud increased from 797 in fiscal year 2008 to 1,430 in fiscal year 2011 – a more than 75 percent increase.<br />
<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infographics/medicare-fraud-0512"><img src="assets/medicarefraudchart_blogprompt_1.jpg" alt="Fighting Medicare Fraud Infographic Promo" width="520" height="175" /></a></p>
<p>Just last week, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice announced “a nationwide takedown by Medicare Fraud Strike Force operations in seven cities has resulted in charges against 107 individuals, including doctors, nurses and other licensed medical professionals, for their alleged participation in Medicare fraud schemes involving approximately $452 million in false billing.”  And on Monday, the Departments announced that, as a part of their Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team initiative, they had resolved an investigation into a pharmaceutical company’s unlawful promotion of a prescription drug.  The Justice Department reported that, “the resolution – the second largest payment by a drug company – includes a criminal fine and forfeiture totaling $700 million and civil settlements with the federal government and the states totaling $800 million.” </p>
<p>The infographic also shows how the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/healthreform">Affordable Care Act</a> is making Medicare stronger and providing new benefits. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>32.5 million people with Medicare received at least one free preventive service thanks to the health care law.</li>
<li>People with Medicare who hit the prescription drug donut hole have already saved $3.4 billion on their prescription drugs.</li>
<li>By 2021, the average person with Medicare will save nearly $4,200 thanks to the new health care law.</li>
</ul>

      <p>Do you know someone older who accidentally bumped their arm and ended up needing a sling? This type of injury could have been caused by osteoporosis. Ten million Americans have osteoporosis, and 34 million more have low bone mass. Osteoporosis means your bones have lost density or mass. As your bones become less dense, they become weaker.</p>
<p>People can’t feel their bones getting weaker. So, you may not know that you have osteoporosis until you break a bone. A person with osteoporosis can fracture a bone from a minor fall, or in serious cases, from a simple action such as a sneeze.</p>
<p>While people of all ages and backgrounds can develop osteoporosis, you’re at higher risk if you’re:</p>
<ul>
<li>White</li>
<li>Older than 50</li>
<li>Small in body size</li>
<li>Eat a diet low in calcium</li>
<li>Not physically active</li>
<li>A post-menopausal woman</li>
</ul>
<p>Medicare can help you prevent or detect osteoporosis at an early stage, when treatment works best. Talk to your doctor about getting a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/bone-mass-measurement.aspx">bone mass measurement</a>–it may be free.</p>
<p>Also, take steps to keep your bones healthy. Get the calcium and vitamin D you need every day, and do regular weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening exercises.</p>
<p>May is National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month—learn more about what puts you at risk for osteoporosis and how to prevent or treat it at the <a href="http://www.nof.org/home">National Osteoporosis Foundation</a> or the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/vitamins/calcium.html">Centers for Disease Control</a>. Also, watch our short <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opQFBVd7oHI?" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> about Medicare’s efforts to curb osteoporosis.</p>

      <p><span style="color:#000000;">Most of us have a friend or relative who has had high blood pressure at some point in their life—it affects the health of approximately 68 million Americans. High blood pressure increases the risk for heart disease and stroke, 2 of the 3 leading causes of death. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">You may even have high blood pressure, so it’s important to get your blood pressure checked routinely. Medicare can help—we cover blood pressure screening as part of your </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/medicare-physical-exam.aspx">“Welcome to Medicare” visit and your Yearly Wellness Visit</a><span style="color:#000000;">—at no cost to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">There are lots of ways you can check your blood pressure regularly, to keep on top of any changes between wellness visits. Check your local newspaper’s events calendar for local senior centers or libraries offering free blood pressure screenings. Visit health fairs that come to your community, where nurses may be on duty to check your blood pressure. Some supermarkets and drug stores offer a free automated machine next to their pharmacies, so why not use it the next time you pick up your prescriptions? You’ll feel good knowing you’re paying attention to an important part of your health.</span></p>

      <p><em>By Marilyn Tavenner, Acting Administrator</em></p>
<p>The day is finally here – weeks after a fall that resulted in a broken hip, you’re ready to go home. You know you’re going to continue to need treatment and services at home, but where do you find a resource to help you through this next step on the road to recovery?</p>
<p>Now there’s an objective and meaningful way to compare other patients’ actual experiences with home health agencies and services—the Home Health Care Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HHCAHPS) Survey – and we’ve just released the first set of survey results on our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/homehealthcompare/search.aspx">Home Health Compare</a> page.</p>
<p>People with Medicare that are getting home health services fill out this short survey that asks about the care they got from the home health agency in the last 2 months, how they’d rate the care, and how strongly they’d recommend that agency.</p>
<p>The initial survey results cover the period from October 2010 to September 2011. Most people who got home health care from Medicare-certified home health agencies during that time said they got the care they needed. In fact:</p>
<ul>
<li>84% of patients gave their home health agency a rating of 9 or 10 on a scale from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest).</li>
<li>80% of patients said “yes, they would definitely recommend the home health agency to friends.”</li>
<li>87% of patients said their home health team provided care in a professional way.</li>
<li>86% said their home health team communicated well with them.</li>
<li>83% said their home health team discussed medicines, pain, and home safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>By making the results public, we help keep home health agencies openly accountable and continuously working to improve their quality of care.</p>
<p>Let Medicare make it easier for you on your road to recovery.  We can help you make an informed decision when choosing a home health agency that best meets your needs—visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/homehealthcompare/search.aspx">Home Health Compare</a> for the latest patient survey results.</p>

      <p><span style="color:#000000;">Speaking and writing about the Medicare program in plain language isn’t just good practice—it’s the law. The Plain Writing Act of 2010 requires us to make sure you’ll find our Web pages, booklets, letters and other materials clear and to the point.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">You don’t have to look far to find examples of plain writing in our publications and on our Web site. Last July we released </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11514.pdf">A Quick Look at Medicare</a><span style="color:#000000;">, an easy-to-read 4-page brochure that sums up what Medicare does, what your choices are, and how you can contact us. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Also, we’ve recently redesigned the </span><a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/04/12/cutting-the-clutter-the-newly-designed-medicare-summary-notice/"><span style="color:#800080;">Medicare Summary Notice</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"> (MSN) to make it easier for you to find and understand your Medicare claims information. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The Affordable Care Act has also given us new opportunities to reach wider audiences with plain writing. For example, we wrote a plain language overview on the health care law for doctors and other health care providers that was mailed with the February edition of <em>WebMD </em>magazine to more than 175,000 doctor’s offices around the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">We’ve made a lot of progress with plain writing during the past 15 months, but there’s still work to do. How do you think Medicare is doing using plain writing in our documents and Web pages? We need to know, so we can make our materials better. Give us feedback on our efforts and learn more about our ongoing commitment to plain writing by visiting the </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/plainlanguage.aspx">CMS Plain Language Web page</a><span style="color:#000000;">.</span></p>
