      <p>More than 66 million Americans care for loved ones who have a chronic illness, disability, or frailties that come naturally with old age.

<p>We all like to plan ahead – whether it’s planning for a road trip next summer or planning a big family get-together. Despite our best planning, uncertainty is a fact of life. We always need a back-up plan. What if the car breaks down?  What if it snows on the day of the get-together?</p>
<p>Nobody likes to think of back-up plans when it comes to our health, but health can be as unpredictable as the weather. It’s hard to know what you’ll feel like next week, much less what health care you’ll need next year. But that’s exactly what you need to think about when you’re shopping for health coverage during Medicare Open Enrollment – which ends on December 7.</p>
<p>Even when future needs can be hard to forecast, taking stock of your current situation can help. Review your prescription drug needs, and look for a plan that meets those needs. Plans may vary in what drugs they cover, and some may have special rules that you must follow before they cover a drug.</p>
<p>You may have other health insurance from a current or past job, or through a family member. If you do, you’ll want to understand exactly how that other coverage works with Medicare. You may decide to keep what you have now – and that’s ok.</p>
<p>It’s worth your time to take a look and compare coverage. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.<span style="color:#000000;"> If you still need help comparing, call 1‑800‑MEDICARE (1‑800‑633‑4227). TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.</span></p>
<p>While you can’t predict everything in life, you can do your best to be prepared. Medicare will be there, stronger than ever, to help.</p>

      <p><i>By: Jonathan Blum, CMS Acting Principal Deputy Administrator and Director, Center for Medicare</i></p>
<p>In today’s world, we’re all a little more conscious of costs. Maybe we clip a few more coupons, eat out less, or compare ads to find the best price on something before we buy. Cost is an important factor in any purchase, and health care is no different. We know you want to get the best value possible from your health care coverage. Wouldn’t most of us like to get more and pay less for things that are important to us?</p>
<p>The good news is the health care law has gone a long way toward <span style="color:#000000;">lowering overall costs</span> in the Medicare program. Average premiums for prescription drug coverage and Medicare health plans will stay around the same in 2013. People who are in Medicare’s prescription drug coverage gap (“donut hole”) will continue to save money in 2013 with big discounts on brand-name prescription drugs. Since the health care law was enacted in 2010, more than 5.5 million people with Medicare have saved nearly $4.5 billion on prescription drugs in the donut hole. </p>
<p>But you still need to make smart choices to get good value out of your health insurance.</p>
<p>There may be dozens of Medicare plans in your area, all with different costs and levels of coverage.<span style="color:#000000;"> Ask yourself:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>How much are each plan’s premiums and deductibles?</li>
<li>How much will I pay for the benefits and services I’m likely to use?</li>
<li>Is there a limit on what I’ll have to pay out-of-pocket for the year?</li>
<li>Does the plan cover the drugs I take?</li>
<li>How much will my prescriptions cost under each plan?</li>
</ul>
<p>Only you can determine what mix of benefits and costs will work best with your needs and budget. Shopping around can make a huge difference, and we want to help. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.<span style="color:#000000;"> If you still need help comparing, call 1‑800‑MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048. </span></p>
<p>Whether it’s groceries, health insurance, phone plans or anything else, we all want the best value for our dollar. Make sure you have the most up-to-date information out there and be a smart shopper during Medicare Open Enrollment – which ends on December 7.</p>

<p> It’s picking season – pumpkins, apples, Halloween candy…and a Medicare health or drug plan. Today is the start of Medicare Open Enrollment!</p>
<p>In my work with Medicare, one of the questions people ask me often is which plan is the best one. That’s not something I can answer, because picking a plan is an important and personal decision. Each person has a unique set of priorities. How do you weigh your options? Now’s the time to think about what matters to you, and pick the Medicare plan that meets your needs.</p>
<p>When you sit down to review your Medicare health and drug plan choices this year, keep track of the things you may want in a plan, and pick one that’s right for you. Here are some things to keep in mind while you consider your choices:</p>
<p><b>Costs</b></p>
<p>You should look at your current health care costs to find coverage that works with your financial situation. How much are your premiums and deductibles? How much do you pay for hospital stays and doctor visits? Just like with everything else, the lowest-premium health plan option might not be the best choice for you.</p>
<p><b>Coverage</b></p>
<p>Are the services you need covered? We know future health care needs can be hard to predict, but changes happen. Maybe your doctor changed your prescriptions this year or you have different health concerns. Make sure you understand what services and benefits you’re likely to use in the coming year and find coverage that meets your needs.</p>
<p><b>Convenience</b></p>
<p>Your time is valuable. When comparing plans, make sure you check which doctors and hospitals you’ll be able to use. Where are they located and what are their hours? Check which pharmacies you can use. Can you get prescriptions by mail? Remember that even if you’re happy with your current plan, these answers might change from year to year.</p>
<p><b>Quality of care</b></p>
<p>Ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan"><span style="color:#800080;">Look for plans</span></a> with a 5‑star performance rating — the right expertise and care may help speed your recovery and improve your outcomes.</p>
<p> It’s worth your time to take a look and compare coverage between now and when Open Enrollment ends on December 7. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan"><span style="color:#800080;">Medicare Plan Finder</span></a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.<span style="color:#000000;"> If you still need help comparing, call 1‑800‑MEDICARE (1‑800‑633‑4227).  </span></p>
<p>Only you know what’s most important to you and your family – that’s why I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make the best decision. Before you consider your Medicare plan options, think about your personal priorities so you can be sure your plan meets your unique needs.</p>
