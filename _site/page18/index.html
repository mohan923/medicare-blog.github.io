      <p><em>By Jonathan Blum, Acting Principal Deputy Administrator and Director of the Center for Medicare</em></p>
<p>In this season of Open Enrollment, people with Medicare have the opportunity to choose the Medicare plan that best serves their unique health needs and provides them with the greatest value. In determining the value of a plan choice, you should look not only at premiums and cost-sharing but also at what benefits and quality of care that money will buy. This year, I am proud to say that while costs, by and large, have remained relatively stable, the benefits that people with Medicare will get for their premiums continues to grow.</p>
<p>For those choosing Original Medicare, the benefit package continues to grow stronger and provide greater value. For example, EVERYONE with Medicare has access to a variety of preventive services and screenings, most at no cost to them when furnished by qualified and participating health care professionals. This includes things like diabetes and cancer screenings, and a yearly “wellness” visit. During the first 9 months of this year, over 20 million people with Original Medicare received at least one preventive service at no cost.</p>
<p>Beneficiaries may also explore their options beyond Original Medicare, as virtually all people with Medicare have access to Medicare Advantage Plans in 2013, and many of these plans offer extra benefits beyond the comprehensive package offered by Original Medicare. Medicare Advantage Plans may offer vision, hearing, or dental coverage, or extend coverage while you travel. And most Medicare Advantage Plans also include prescription drug coverage.</p>
<p>Use this time to decide what benefits are most important in helping you meet your unique health care needs. Use the Medicare Plan Finder to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area for what will provide you with the greatest value. If you still need help comparing, call 1 800 MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.</p>
<p>Only you know what extra benefits and services are most important for you. Just know that no matter how you choose to get your Medicare benefits, you’ll be getting more.</p>

      <p><i>By: Patrick Conway, M.D., Director and Chief Medical Officer, CMS Center for Clinical Standards and Quality</i></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">As we enter flu season, you may seek fast relief when illness strikes, but think twice before asking your doctor for antibiotics. Did you know that </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/know-and-do.html"><span style="color:#800080;">if you have a cold or flu, antibiotics won't work for you?</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"> That’s because antibiotics cure bacterial infections, not viral infections. Every time someone takes antibiotics, sensitive bacteria are killed, but resistant germs may survive to grow and multiply.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Antibiotic resistance, caused by overuse and misuse of antibiotics, is one of the world’s most pressing public health problems. These drug-resistant bacteria—which were once easily treatable—can now cause significant harm and suffering. When antibiotics fail to work, we get longer-lasting illnesses, need more doctor visits or extended hospital stays, and more expensive medications.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">If you or a loved one lives in a nursing home, pay close attention to when antibiotics are prescribed. Roughly  2 out of 3 nursing home residents get at least one course of antibiotics each year, yet nearly 27,000 residents end up with antibiotic-resistant infections each year. These infections are often severe, difficult to treat, and lead to more hospitalizations and deaths among people over 65.  If you have questions, please ask your health care provider.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The CDC has marked November 12—18 as </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/index.html"><span style="color:#800080;">Get Smart About Antibiotics Week</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">. You can take several steps to make certain you’re using antibiotics properly:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Take antibiotics only to treat a true bacterial infection. It should be for only as long as your doctor prescribed to treat the infection, to reduce your risk of getting the infection again, or to reduce the risk to those around you. </span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Always talk to your doctor before taking an antibiotic to be sure it will treat the infection you have.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Never take antibiotics for a <i>viral</i> infection, such as a cold, cough, or the flu. Antibiotics won’t cure your virus, they won’t keep those around you from getting the illness, and they won’t help you feel better. In fact, taking antibiotics when you have a virus may do you more harm than good, because you increase your risk of getting an antibiotic-resistant infection later. </span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">Not sure if you have a virus, which can’t be treated by antibiotics? </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/campaign-materials/print-materials/VirusBacteriaChart-bw.pdf">Get smart—read this chart!</a><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Antibiotics won’t help you recover from the flu, but keep yourself from catching the major flu viruses in the first place by getting your </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/flu-shots.html"><span style="color:#800080;">flu shot</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">! It’s free for people with Medicare, once per flu season in the fall or winter, when given by doctors or other health care providers (such as senior centers and pharmacies) that take Medicare.</span></p>

      <p><i>By: Jonathan Blum, CMS Acting Principal Deputy Administrator and Director, Center for Medicare</i></p>
<p>We all like to plan ahead – whether it’s planning for a road trip next summer or planning a big family get-together. Despite our best planning, uncertainty is a fact of life. We always need a back-up plan. What if the car breaks down?  What if it snows on the day of the get-together?</p>
<p>Nobody likes to think of back-up plans when it comes to our health, but health can be as unpredictable as the weather. It’s hard to know what you’ll feel like next week, much less what health care you’ll need next year. But that’s exactly what you need to think about when you’re shopping for health coverage during Medicare Open Enrollment – which ends on December 7.</p>
<p>Even when future needs can be hard to forecast, taking stock of your current situation can help. Review your prescription drug needs, and look for a plan that meets those needs. Plans may vary in what drugs they cover, and some may have special rules that you must follow before they cover a drug.</p>
<p>You may have other health insurance from a current or past job, or through a family member. If you do, you’ll want to understand exactly how that other coverage works with Medicare. You may decide to keep what you have now – and that’s ok.</p>
<p>It’s worth your time to take a look and compare coverage. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.<span style="color:#000000;"> If you still need help comparing, call 1‑800‑MEDICARE (1‑800‑633‑4227).

<p>While you can’t predict everything in life, you can do your best to be prepared. Medicare will be there, stronger than ever, to help.</p>
