    <article class="post-content">
      <p>Now that it’s January, here are a few things to ask yourself to make sure you’re ready for 2012.</p>
<p><strong>1. Do you have the right insurance card to use when you go to the doctor?</strong><br />
If you changed your health or drug plan during Medicare’s Open Enrollment period and haven’t gotten your new card or welcome packet, contact your plan for help.</p>
<p>If you changed from a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) back to Original Medicare, use your red, white, and blue Medicare card when you go to the doctor. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/MedicareEligibility/home.asp?dest=NAV%7CHome%7CGeneralEnrollment%7CAboutCard&amp;version=default&amp;browser=Chrome%7C16%7CWinXP&amp;language=English#TabTop">Get a new card if you lost or damaged yours, or need to update your information</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Did you budget for this year’s Medicare Part B deductible?</strong><br />
Don’t forget, if you have Medicare Part B and are in Original Medicare, now that it’s a new year you’ll have to meet your deductible before your Medicare coverage pays for services and supplies.</p>
<p>This year, the Medicare Part B deductible is $140 – lower than last year! Make sure to plan your health care budget to account for the increased cost of doctor visits for the time that it will take to cover your deductible.</p>
<p><strong>3. Have you made appointments to get any preventive tests or screenings?</strong><br />
Medicare covers many <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/preventive-service-overview.aspx">preventive services</a> to keep you healthy and screenings to check for health problems. Many of these services are covered each year. Ask your doctor when during the year you should schedule your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/medicare-physical-exam.aspx">wellness visit</a> and other screenings. You can also use <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">mymedicare.gov</a> to track your visits and make a calendar of preventive services.</p>
<p>Medicare also covers 2 new preventive services:<br />
       1. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/alcohol-misuse-counseling.aspx">Alcohol Misuse Screenings<br />
</a>       2. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/depression-screenings.aspx">Depression Counseling<br />
</a><br />
Talk to your doctor about these covered preventive services to find out what’s right for your health needs.</p>
<p><strong>4. Does your drug or health plan meet your needs?</strong><br />
If not, Medicare has a new way for you to get the coverage you want instead of having to wait for this year’s Open Enrollment. At any time during the year, you can switch to a Medicare Advantage Plan or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan that has a 5-star rating.</p>
<p>Plan ratings are based on member surveys, information from doctors and health care providers, and other sources. The plan ratings are scores that show the quality and performance of the plan, on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 being the highest rated plans.</p>
<p>You can make this change once per calendar year. <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Find 5-star health and drug plans in your area</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Is your doctor using Electronic Health Records and Electronic Prescribing to provide better care?</strong><br />
Using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and electronic prescribing can help reduce paperwork, medical errors, and health care costs. These methods can also help doctors communicate better with each other about your care. For example, when you visit a specialist, your primary care doctor can send them your screening information and results. That way, you won’t have to have duplicate screenings and tests. Ask your doctor about what they’re doing to use EHRs and electronic prescribing to better coordinate your health care. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/personal-health-records/personal-health-records-overview.aspx">Find out more about EHRs and electronic prescribing</a>.</p>
<p>Remember to check <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/">http://www.medicare.gov/</a> for the latest Medicare news and information, and have a healthy 2012.</p>

      <p>Do you have diabetes, a family history of glaucoma, or are you African American and age 50 or older? If so, your risk of getting glaucoma may be higher. With the start of a new year, it’s the perfect time to schedule a regular eye exam to check for glaucoma.

      <p><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Do you or a loved one get kidney disease treatments? Do you ever wonder if you’re getting quality care or what Medicare does to make sure you’re getting quality care? To make sure you’re getting the best quality care, Medicare has a new Value-Based Purchasing “Quality Incentive Program.” This program encourages facilities to provide excellent care, which is best for your health and safety.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">Medicare is paying dialysis facilities for providing quality care</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">When Medicare pays a facility for your care, it expects that care to be of good quality. Starting this month, dialysis facilities that don’t meet treatment standards, or improve from their past results, will have their claims payments reduced. What this means is that facilities have an incentive to provide you with better quality care.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family:Calibri;"><span style="font-size:small;">Look for a certificate in your dialysis facility</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">The next time you visit your dialysis facility, you should see a certificate posted showing how well the facility did in the Quality Incentive Program. Facilities are rated on measures important to your treatment, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">management of your low red blood cell count (anemia) by dialysis and medications</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">effectiveness of your dialysis (how much waste, or urea, is removed from your blood)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">You can view a facility’s certificate online using </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Dialysis/"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Dialysis Facility Compare</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">, and also see other information including what services are offered, whether the facility has evening hours, and if they offer training. You can use this information to find a dialysis facility that meets your needs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Learn More</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">The Quality Incentive Program will improve care for all patients. Talk to your dialysis care team about what these results mean for your care. Read about </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/10128.pdf"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">Medicare’s coverage for dialysis and kidney disease education</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">, and </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Dialysis/"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">find a dialysis facility near you</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">.</span></p>
