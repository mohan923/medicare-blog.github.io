<p><em>By Julia Eisman, HHS New Media Communications Director. Crosspost from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/11/givingthanks11082011.html">Healthcare.gov</a></em></p>
</div>
<div>Every day we receive letters, emails, tweets and Facebook messages from people around the country that have been touched by the health care law – like a parent whose child is no longer denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition or a senior who has received a 50% discount on prescription drugs.</div>
<div>
<p>There are a lot of ways that the law, signed 20 months ago, has provided significant relief to families throughout the country, easing worries and ensuring that focus is on health, not on fighting with insurance companies over the phone. Chances are, someone in your family is seeing new rights and benefits.</p>
<p>In the spirit of Thanksgiving, during the month of November on our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/healthcaregov">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/healthcaregov">Facebook</a> pages we’ll be highlighting these benefits and sharing some of the stories we’ve heard from people around the country who have been helped by the law. We also want to hear from you, so we encourage you to tell us your story about how you’ve been helped by benefits in the law. Share on Twitter with the hashtag #ThanksHCR. You can find us on Twitter at: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/healthcaregov">@HealthCareGov</a>.</p>
<p>To give you an idea, here are a few new benefits we have thanks to the health care law:</p>
<p>Thanks to health reform, insurers <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/09/1yearpatientsbillofrights09232011.html">cannot deny coverage</a> to children due to pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>Thanks to health reform, preventive services will be available <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/index.html">for millions for free</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to health reform, <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/2011/08/women.html">being a woman</a> will soon no longer be considered a pre-existing condition.</p>
<p>Thanks to health reform, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/01/21/voices-health-reform-pauls-story">people with Medicare</a> get discounts on prescription drugs and a free annual wellness visit, AKA more time with their doctor.</p>
<p>Thanks to health reform, young adults under 26 can <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/09/youngadults09212011.html">stay on their parents’ health insurance</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to health reform, insurers can <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/10/ratereview10072011.html">no longer raise rates</a> with no accountability.</p>
<p>Thanks to health reform, insurers must spend most of your premium dollar towards your health care instead of on advertising or big CEO salaries. If they don't, they must <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/costs/value-for-premium/index.html">provide refunds to you</a>.</p>
<p>And the list goes on…</p>
<p>Many of the items in the law are common-sense provisions that end the worst insurance company abuses. From new consumer rights like appealing denied insurance claims, to new benefits like prescription drug rebates for Seniors, there are a lot of reasons to be thankful.</p>
<p>Join us on Twitter this November in saying thanks and share your story.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><em>By Jonathan Blum, Deputy Administrator and Director Center for Medicare</em></p>
<p>We’ve all had the experience of making outdoor plans for a weekend that’s supposed to be gorgeous, only to cancel when the weather turns out to be 48 degrees and drizzly. Despite our best planning, uncertainty is just a fact of life.</p>
<p>Health can be as unpredictable as the weather. It’s hard to know what you’ll feel like next week, much less what health care you’ll need next year – yet that’s exactly what you need to predict when you’re shopping for health coverage during Medicare Open Enrollment.</p>
<p>We know future needs can be hard to forecast, but taking stock of current circumstances can help. Maybe your family situation is different this year, or you have new health concerns. Maybe you’ve been traveling a lot, so you want a flexible plan that offers coverage in multiple states.</p>
<p>If you’ve recently retired —or even if you’re still working — you may have other health insurance options. If you do, make sure you understand exactly how that other coverage works with Medicare.</p>
<p>The good news is that now more than ever, you can find a plan tailored to your unique needs. There are better prescription drug plan choices, with premiums that generally have held steady from last year. A full 99% of people with Medicare have access to Medicare Advantage Plans. Even better, Medicare Advantage Plan premiums in 2012 are 4% lower, on average, than they were this year.</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act delivered <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/">better choices and more benefits </a>to the Medicare program. So no matter which plan you pick, you’ll have access to benefits like these:</p>
<p>• A 50% discount on covered brand-name drugs if you hit the Part D prescription drug coverage gap (“donut hole”)</p>
<p>• A free Annual Wellness Visit, so you can sit down with your doctor and talk about your health concerns and the best ways to stay healthy</p>
<p>• A host of preventive tests and screenings — including cancer screenings — most at no cost to you</p>
<p>It’s worth it to take a look and compare coverage. We recently learned about a man in central Arkansas who’s had Medicare Part D since 2009. Last year, our State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) counselors helped him compare his Part D drug coverage with other plan options. They found a new plan that covered more of the prescriptions he needs. The <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder </a>can help you compare plans – check out our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQQJ7ry_H6k">video on how the Plan Finder works</a>.</p>
<p>So this year, this gentleman has been spending only $18.90 for 3 prescriptions each month — which saves him more than $720 a month. That’s real money.</p>
<p>As you start comparing coverage for yourself, you’ll find Medicare <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/11/medicare-open-enrollment-4-places-to-look-for-medicare-information/">in the mail, on TV or the radio, in the paper, and on your computer</a>. You’ll be hearing so much about Open Enrollment that it may not surprise you to get phone calls or visits to your house from people selling Medicare plans.</p>
<p>Remember to keep yourself and your personal information safe [link to blog #4 on fraud when posted]- we’ll <strong>never</strong> call and ask for your Medicare number or bank information, and we’ll <strong>never</strong> come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products. Visit <a href="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/">stopmedicarefraud.gov </a>to learn what to do if this happens to you.</p>
<p>While you can’t always predict everything in life, you can do your best to be prepared. Medicare will be there to help you, stronger than ever.</p>

      <p><em>By Jonathan Blum, Deputy Administrator and Director for the Center of Medicare </em></p>
<p>In today’s world, we’re all a little more conscious of costs.  Maybe we clip a few more coupons, eat out less, or compare ads to find the best price on something before we buy. </p>
<p>Cost is a primary driver in any marketplace, and health care is no different. We know you want to get the best value possible from your health care coverage. Wouldn’t most of us like to get more and pay less for things that are important to us?</p>
<p>The good news is, the health care law has gone a long way toward <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/">lowering overall costs</a> in the Medicare program.  But getting good value out of your health insurance still requires you to make smart choices.</p>
<p>There may be dozens of Medicare plans in your area, all with different costs and levels of coverage.  How much are each plan’s premiums and deductibles? How much will you pay for the benefits and services you’re likely to use? Is there a limit on what you’ll have to pay out-of-pocket for the year?</p>
<p>Prescription drug coverage is another part of the cost puzzle. How much will your prescriptions cost under each plan?  Does the plan cover the drugs you take? Remember that this year, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, everyone who reaches the Part D coverage gap (or “donut hole”) will benefit from a <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/prescription/drugdiscounts.html">50% discount on covered brand-name drugs</a>.</p>
<p>Finding the right plan can save you hundreds — or even thousands — over the course of a year. In Florida, State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) counselors used the <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to help one senior find a drug plan that covered all but one of her 17 medications, saving her $510 a month in co-payments. </p>
<p>Only you can determine what mix of benefits and costs will work best with your needs and budget. Shopping around can make a huge difference. Sometimes that shopping takes more time or can feel overwhelming.</p>
<p>That’s why we want to help you take control over your Medicare coverage.  Look around for <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/11/medicare-open-enrollment-4-places-to-look-for-medicare-information/">all the Medicare information out there</a>, visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/open-enrollment/">Open Enrollment center</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQQJ7ry_H6k">watch a video about how the Medicare Plan Finder works.</a> After you’ve narrowed your options, you can call the plans you’re interested in to get more details about their benefits and services, or check out their websites.</p>
<p>Whether groceries, health insurance, phone plans or anything else, you want value for your dollar.  Make sure you have the most up-to-date information out there. </p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><em>By Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services. Crosspost from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/10/medicare10272011.html">Healthcare.gov</a></em></p>
<p>Across the country, people with Medicare are now considering their options for 2012. Medicare’s annual <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/10/openenrollment101111.html">Open Enrollment </a>period opened on October 15 and closes December 7. While that seven-week period is longer than usual, it also ends on an earlier date. So seniors and people with disabilities along with their families and caregivers are examining their options and making their choices now.</p>
<p>The good news is there are better choices available and we’re controlling the cost of coverage. Earlier this year, we announced that premiums for Part D prescription drug coverage will remain virtually unchanged and average Medicare Advantage plan premiums will actually go down by 4 percent. That’s the second consecutive year of falling premiums for the millions of people who choose Medicare Advantage.</p>
<p>Today, we have more good news. Medicare’s Part B monthly premium, which helps pay for physicians’ services, outpatient hospital services, certain home health services, and other items, is rising by only $3.50 despite earlier projections of a much bigger jump.</p>
<p>For the last two years, the Part B premium has been frozen for most people with Medicare because their Social Security benefits were not increasing. But this year, Social Security benefits are rising 3.6 percent to cover inflation – the same percent increase as Medicare’s premium. For example, the typical retired worker will see a $39 per month increase in their Social Security check. This more than offsets the modest $3.50 change in Medicare premiums which will be the same percent of Social Security checks in 2012 as they were in 2008. In addition, Medicare’s Part B deductible will actually fall by over $20, from $161 to $140.</p>
<p>At the same time, Medicare is providing new benefits thanks to the Affordable Care Act. The health reform law reduces prescription drug costs for people who hit the donut hole and makes preventive benefits like cancer screenings and cholesterol tests free for everyone with Medicare. Through September 2011, nearly 20.5 million people in traditional Medicare received a free preventive service. Through August of this year, nearly 1.8 million people who hit the donut hole received these discounts, saving almost $1 billion – coming to an average of $530 per beneficiary.</p>
<p>Put simply, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Medicare is providing <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2011/07/medicare07282011.html">better benefits at lower costs</a>. Today’s announcement means seniors will have more money in their pocket. And seniors and people with disabilities are getting a Medicare program that’s stronger for today and tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Medicare is ready to help you quit smoking.</p>
<p>About one out of every six cancer deaths in the U.S. comes from lung cancer. Each year, nearly 200,000 Americans are told they have lung cancer and more than 90,000 people die from this disease. Smoking causes 80 to 90 percent of lung cancer cases, so many of these lung cancer deaths can be prevented.</p>
<p>If you haven’t been diagnosed with an illness caused or complicated by tobacco use, you can get 8 face-to-face <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/smoking-cessation.aspx">smoking cessation </a>counseling sessions during a 12-month period. You pay nothing for these counseling sessions, as long as you get them from a qualified doctor or another Medicare provider.</p>
<p>Talk with your doctor about Medicare-covered smoking cessation programs near you, and visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/smoking-cessation.aspx">smoking cessation</a> page to find more resources.</p>
