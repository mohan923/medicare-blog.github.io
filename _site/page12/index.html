      <p>It’s picking season – pumpkins, apples, Halloween candy…and a Medicare health or drug plan. Today is the start of Medicare Open Enrollment!</p>
<p>Picking a plan is an important and personal decision. Now’s the time to think about what matters to you, and pick the Medicare plan that meets your needs. Here are some things to think about:</p>
<p><b>Does the plan cover the services you need? </b></p>
<p>Future health care needs can be hard to predict, but changes happen. Make sure you understand what services and benefits you’re likely to use in the coming year and find coverage that meets your needs. If you have other types of health or prescription drug coverage, make sure you understand <a href="http://medicare.gov/supplement-other-insurance/how-medicare-works-with-other-insurance/how-medicare-works-with-other-insurance.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">how that coverage works with Medicare</span></a>. And, if you travel a lot, does your plan cover you when you’re away from home?</p>
<p>No matter what plan you pick, you’ll have better choices and more benefits thanks to the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/affordable-care-act.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Affordable Care Act</span></a> like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>A discount of more than <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">50% on covered brand-name drugs</span></a> if you hit the Part D prescription drug coverage gap (“donut hole”)</li>
<li>A free <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">yearly “wellness” visit</span></a>, so you can sit down with your doctor and talk about your health concerns and the best ways to stay healthy</li>
<li>A host of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">preventive tests and screenings</span></a> — including cancer screenings —  most at no cost to you</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What’s the cost? </b></p>
<p>The lowest-cost health plan option might not be the best choice for you – consider things like the cost of premiums and deductibles, how much you pay for hospital stays and doctor visits, and whether it’s important for you to have expenses balanced throughout the year.</p>
<p><b>How about convenience? </b></p>
<p>Your time is valuable. Where are the doctors’ offices? What are their hours? Which pharmacies can you use? Can you get prescriptions by mail? Do the doctors use <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-health-records/electronic-health-records.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">electronic health records</span></a> or <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-prescribing/electronic-prescribing.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">prescribe electronically</span></a>? Remember that even if you’re happy with your current plan, these answers might change from year to year.</p>
<p>Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. Open Enrollment is also a good time to ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Look for plans</a> with a 5‑star performance rating — the right expertise and care can make a difference. The <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Medicare Plan Finder</span></a> makes it easy to compare plans so you can pick a plan that meets your needs.</p>

      <p>As the days get shorter and the nights get cooler, you can expect to hear more about Medicare. That’s because October 15 – December 7 is Medicare Open Enrollment, and it’s your chance to review your health care coverage and see if you need to make any changes, or if you’re happy sticking with the plan you have.</p>
<p>This year, you may hear a lot about the Health Insurance Marketplace. The <b>Marketplace</b> Open Enrollment period (October 1, 2013–March 31, 2014) overlaps with the <b>Medicare</b> Open Enrollment period (October 15–December 7, 2013). The Marketplace is designed to help people who don’t have any health coverage. If you have health coverage through Medicare,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/medicare-and-the-marketplace.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;"> the<span style="font-family:Calibri;"> </span>Marketplace<span style="font-family:Calibri;"> </span>won’t have any effect on your Medicare<span style="font-family:Calibri;"> </span>coverage</span></a>.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, look around – you’ll find a wealth of information about your Medicare benefits, especially in these everyday places:</p>
<p><b>1. In the mail</b></p>
<p>Look through your mail carefully — you may get important notices from your current plan, Medicare, or Social Security about changes to your coverage or any <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/save-on-drug-costs/save-on-drug-costs.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">extra help</span></a> you may get paying for prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Also look for your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/medicare-and-you/medicare-and-you.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Medicare &amp; You</span></a> handbook. Like an old friend, it shows up around the same time every year. If you decided to “<a href="https://www.medicare.gov/gopaperless/home.aspx"><span style="color:#0000ff;">go paperless</span></a>,”<span style="color:#000000;"> you’ll get an email pointing you to </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">medicare.gov</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"> where you can get all the same information.</span></p>
<p>You’ll also start to see brochures from companies that offer Medicare health and drug plans. Just remember,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/forms-help-and-resources/report-fraud-and-abuse/prevent-fraud/tips-to-prevent-fraud.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;"> be smart about protecting your personal information and your identity</span></a> — plans aren’t allowed to call or come to your home without an invitation from you. And, it’s against the law for someone who knows that you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan.</p>
<p><b>2.     </b><b>On your computer </b></p>
<p>Comparing your plan choices is important. Our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Medicare Plan Finder</span></a> is ready with all of the 2014 cost information to make it as easy as possible. Enter the drugs you take to find out how you can lower your costs, review the plan’s <span style="color:#000000;">ratings</span> to compare plan quality, and join a plan right online if you find one that meets your needs. If you haven’t used the Plan Finder before, check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SCvgSZURBA#t=34"><span style="color:#0000ff;">video</span></a> to help you get started.</p>
<p><b>3.     </b><b>In newspapers, magazines, TV and radio</b></p>
<p>Take a moment as you enjoy these crisp mornings to tune into the Medicare information that’s out there. You may find a local event — somewhere right around the corner with counselors to help you, like your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/contacts"><span style="color:#0000ff;">State Health Insurance Assistance Program</span></a>. Don’t miss the chance to get personalized help if you need it!</p>
<p>Now’s the time to enjoy the choice and control you have over your health care coverage. Just like fall, Medicare Open Enrollment only comes once a year.</p>

      <p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Mammograms are breast cancer screening tests that can often detect a lump before you or your doctor can feel it. This can help detect breast cancer early, when it’s the most treatable. All women over 40 should have a screening mammogram every 12 months – and </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/mammograms.html"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Medicare covers it at no cost</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;"> if your doctor accepts assignment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Talk to your doctor about risk factors, and to schedule your next screening. Take control of your health – better health is in your hands.</span></p>
