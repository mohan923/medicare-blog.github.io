<p>With the holiday season upon us, it’s easy to get busy this time of year. Some pretty important tasks can get left to the last minute. One of those important tasks is ensuring you are in the right health insurance plan in Medicare.  Selecting the right plan is a personal choice, and a lot of thoughtful consideration goes into finding the right match.  But just like the holidays, those key dates come whether or not you are ready.</p>
<p>If you haven’t made up your mind yet about a health or drug plan, now is the time to make your selection.  Medicare Open Enrollment ends on December 7.  To help you sort through your choices, try using the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/your-medicare-coverage.html?q=plan%20finder">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to review the options in your area. It can help you decide the best mix of benefits and costs that meet your needs and budget. </p>
<p>If you’re like <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/mycare/stories.html#helen">Helen Rayon from Philadelphia</a> and find yourself in Medicare’s prescription drug coverage gap (“donut hole”), you will continue to save money in 2013 with big discounts on brand-name prescription drugs.  More than 5.6 million people like Helen have saved over $5 billion on prescription drugs in the donut hole since 2010.</p>
<p>In these last few days of Medicare Open Enrollment, take a second to review your options.  If you like your current health care coverage, you don’t need to do anything. But if you’re thinking about making any changes, now is the time to act and cross another item off your to-do list.</p>

Medicare has a special program called “</span><a href="http://medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/save-on-drug-costs/save-on-drug-costs.html"><span style="color:#800080;">Extra Help</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">.” If you have limited income and resources you can sign up to get help paying things like </span><span style="color:#000000;">monthly premiums, annual deductibles, and prescription copayments in your Medicare drug plan.

      <p><i>By Jonathan Blum, Acting Principal Deputy Administrator and Director of the Center for Medicare</i></p>
<p>Like most people, I take comfort in the things I’m familiar with. I choose to shop at the supermarket around the corner because I know exactly where to find the things I’m looking for. Sure, I might be able to save a little more money by shopping at a different store on the other side of town, but I choose to stick with what I’m most comfortable. We all like to get a good deal, but convenience is a big part of the value.</p>
<p>The same is true when it comes to choosing a health plan: convenience matters. So in addition to <span style="color:#000000;">cost</span>, <span style="color:#000000;">coverage</span>, and <span style="color:#000000;">benefits</span>, here are some other things you may want to consider as you compare Medicare options during Open Enrollment:</p>
<p><b>Doctor and hospital choice</b></p>
<p>You want to be comfortable with the people you’re working with, especially when it comes to something as private as your health. Will your doctors and hospitals accept your current coverage next year? If you’re thinking about changing plans, make sure you check which doctors and hospitals you’ll be able to use. Where are they located, and what are their hours?</p>
<p><b>Pharmacy access</b></p>
<p>Is the pharmacy you use included in your drug plan’s network? Do they <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-prescribing/electronic-prescribing.html">prescribe electronically</a>? Can you get refills by mail? Remember that plan networks can change from year to year. If it’s important to you to stay with the same pharmacy, it’s worth checking to make sure they’ll still be in your plan’s network.</p>
<p><b>Travel</b></p>
<p>Maybe you travel a lot, or spend part of the year in a different state. If you do, make sure you know whether your coverage will travel with you.</p>
<p>We’re working hard to make sure you have choices in the way you get the Medicare benefits you’ve earned – and we want you to be comfortable. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Medicare Plan Finder</a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area. <span style="color:#000000;">If you still need help comparing, call 1‑800‑MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). </span></p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><i><span style="color:#000000;">By: Marilyn Tavenner, Acting CMS Administrator </span></i></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">We’re now past the halfway point for Medicare’s annual Open Enrollment period, which opened on October 15 and closes December 7. As you and your loved ones with Medicare sit down to consider your options for 2013, we’d like to share the latest news about Medicare.</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Our Administration is committed to making Medicare stronger for you and future generations. Thanks to the health care law, everyone on Medicare can get preventive services like mammograms and other cancer screenings for free. The health care law also makes prescription drugs more affordable for seniors who hit the donut hole. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">These new benefits are making a difference for millions of Americans. 5.6 million seniors and people with disabilities have saved $4.8 billion on prescription drugs since the law was enacted, and during the first nine months of 2012 over 20.7 million people with original Medicare got at least one preventive service at no cost to them.</span> </p>
<p>These and other parts of the law will result in significant savings. We estimate that the health care law will <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/2012/beneficiarysavings/ib.shtml">save the average person in traditional Medicare $5,000 through 2022</a>.  <span style="color:#000000;">Earlier this year we projected that the standard premium for Medicare Part B (which covers certain doctors' services, outpatient care, medical supplies, and preventive services) would rise by more than $9.00 a month in 2013. Today we announce</span><span style="color:#000000;">d that the actual rise will be lower—$5.00—bringing 2013 Part B premiums to $104.90 a month. By law, the premium must cover a percent of Medicare’s expenses; premium increases are in line with projected cost increases.  Medicare Part B premiums have gone up slowly over the past five years – an average of less than 2 percent a year, or $8.50 total.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Several other changes in 2013 include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><b>Medicare Part A Premium:</b> Part A covers inpatient hospital stays, care in a skilled nursing facility, hospice care, and some home health care. Only about 1 percent of people with Medicare pay a premium for Part A services—you need to have paid Medicare payroll taxes for 40 quarters of employment or be married to someone who did. For those few affected, the 2013 Part A premium is decreasing to $441, down from $451 in 2012.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><b>Medicare Part A Deductible: </b>This deductible is the cost to people with Medicare for up to 60 days of Medicare-covered inpatient services in the hospitals for each benefit period (a benefit period starts the day a patient is admitted and ends when the patient has been out of the hospital for 60 days in a row.)  This will increase to $1,184 in 2013, up from $1156 this year (an increase of 2.4%).</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><b>Medicare Part B Deductible:</b> The deductible will increase to $147 in 2013, from $140. This is still $15 below the deductible in 2011. </span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><b>Income-related Adjustments:</b> People with Medicare who report 2011income above $85,000 a year ($170,000 filing jointly) are legally responsible to cover a larger portion of the cost of their coverage.  These premium adjustments range from $42.00 to $230.80 a month for Medicare Part B.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">As Open Enrollment finishes up and we approach a new year, people with Medicare can be assured they are part of a program that strives to deliver better benefits while curbing costs. And we will continue to do all we can to make Medicare even stronger.</span></p>
