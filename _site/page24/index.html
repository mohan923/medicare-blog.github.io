      <p><em>By Marilyn Tavenner, Acting Administrator</em></p>
<p>The day is finally here – weeks after a fall that resulted in a broken hip, you’re ready to go home. You know you’re going to continue to need treatment and services at home, but where do you find a resource to help you through this next step on the road to recovery?</p>
<p>Now there’s an objective and meaningful way to compare other patients’ actual experiences with home health agencies and services—the Home Health Care Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HHCAHPS) Survey – and we’ve just released the first set of survey results on our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/homehealthcompare/search.aspx">Home Health Compare</a> page.</p>
<p>People with Medicare that are getting home health services fill out this short survey that asks about the care they got from the home health agency in the last 2 months, how they’d rate the care, and how strongly they’d recommend that agency.</p>
<p>The initial survey results cover the period from October 2010 to September 2011. Most people who got home health care from Medicare-certified home health agencies during that time said they got the care they needed. In fact:</p>
<ul>
<li>84% of patients gave their home health agency a rating of 9 or 10 on a scale from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest).</li>
<li>80% of patients said “yes, they would definitely recommend the home health agency to friends.”</li>
<li>87% of patients said their home health team provided care in a professional way.</li>
<li>86% said their home health team communicated well with them.</li>
<li>83% said their home health team discussed medicines, pain, and home safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>By making the results public, we help keep home health agencies openly accountable and continuously working to improve their quality of care.</p>
<p>Let Medicare make it easier for you on your road to recovery.  We can help you make an informed decision when choosing a home health agency that best meets your needs—visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/homehealthcompare/search.aspx">Home Health Compare</a> for the latest patient survey results.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><span style="color:#000000;">Speaking and writing about the Medicare program in plain language isn’t just good practice—it’s the law. The Plain Writing Act of 2010 requires us to make sure you’ll find our Web pages, booklets, letters and other materials clear and to the point.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">You don’t have to look far to find examples of plain writing in our publications and on our Web site. Last July we released </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11514.pdf">A Quick Look at Medicare</a><span style="color:#000000;">, an easy-to-read 4-page brochure that sums up what Medicare does, what your choices are, and how you can contact us. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Also, we’ve recently redesigned the </span><a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/04/12/cutting-the-clutter-the-newly-designed-medicare-summary-notice/"><span style="color:#800080;">Medicare Summary Notice</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"> (MSN) to make it easier for you to find and understand your Medicare claims information. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The Affordable Care Act has also given us new opportunities to reach wider audiences with plain writing. For example, we wrote a plain language overview on the health care law for doctors and other health care providers that was mailed with the February edition of <em>WebMD </em>magazine to more than 175,000 doctor’s offices around the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">We’ve made a lot of progress with plain writing during the past 15 months, but there’s still work to do. How do you think Medicare is doing using plain writing in our documents and Web pages? We need to know, so we can make our materials better. Give us feedback on our efforts and learn more about our ongoing commitment to plain writing by visiting the </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/plainlanguage.aspx">CMS Plain Language Web page</a><span style="color:#000000;">.</span></p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><em>By: Margaret Hamburg, M.D. Crosspost from <a href="http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2012/03/getting-more-accurate-tobacco-information-to-consumers">FDAVoice</a></em></p>
<p>Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease and death in our country. And this Administration is committed to implementing strategies that will stop our nation’s youth from starting to use tobacco and also help adults to quit. Today we’re taking <a href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm297925.htm"><span style="color:#0857bf;">two critical steps</span></a> forward that will help reduce harm from tobacco and tobacco products.</p>
<p>Americans will soon have more information on the chemicals found in certain tobacco products, reflecting FDA’s commitment to inform and protect the <a title="Less Risky Tobacco Product? Only if the Science Says So" href="http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm297895.htm"><span style="color:#0857bf;">public</span></a>. For the first time ever, tobacco companies will be required to report the quantity of harmful and potentially harmful constituents – <a href="http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ucm297741.htm"><span style="color:#0857bf;">HPHCs</span></a> – that are in their products to the FDA.</p>
<p>The detailed information that we receive will help FDA determine how best to make science-based decisions to reduce the terrible toll of tobacco-related disease and death. We also hope that by having to disclose this information, industry will voluntarily start to make their products substantially less addictive and harmful.</p>
<p>We are also forging new territory as we seek to ensure that tobacco companies provide accurate information and will not be able to mislead American consumers, especially by making it sound like certain products are less risky than they are. The landmark Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act signed by President Obama gives FDA the authority to ensure the claims for tobacco products marketed to reduce risk or exposure, such as “low tar” or “light,” are truthful and demonstrated by sound science.</p>
<p>So today we issued a draft guidance that provides direction for tobacco companies when they submit applications for modified risk tobacco products – <a href="http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ucm297747"><span style="color:#0857bf;">MRTPs</span></a> – tobacco products that are sold, distributed, or marketed to the public for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease.</p>
<p>We want to make sure <a title="What Are You Smoking (or Chewing or Inhaling)?" href="http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm297878.htm"><span style="color:#0857bf;">consumers</span></a> and the public have an accurate understanding of the health risks of tobacco products—so mistaken beliefs don’t cause them to start or continue using products that lead to preventable disease and death.</p>
<p>We are doing everything that we can to protect all Americans – especially our youth – from the dangers of tobacco, and we’re hopeful these two additional steps will accelerate our goal to make tobacco-related disease and death part of America’s past – not its future.</p>

      <p><span style="color:#000000;">It’s a whole lot easier to read and understand your </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/glossary/m.html#msn">Medicare Summary Notice</a><span style="color:#000000;"> (MSN), thanks to a recently completed redesign. You’ll see a brand new format when you check your MSN at </span><a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/"><span style="color:#800080;">MyMedicare.gov</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/"><span style="color:#800080;">MyMedicare.gov</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"> gives you faster access to your Medicare claims information—you can check it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Customize your MSN to see procedures broken down by single claim, or by a time period you choose, and print out your own statement anytime. Reviewing your MSN online means a shorter wait to see what you were charged for health care services, medical supplies or equipment, and how much Medicare paid.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">We want the MSN to be something that makes it easier for you to find and understand your Medicare claims information.  We spent more than a year improving it. We did one-one-one interviews and focus groups with people like you, and used their feedback to improve the design and language.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">As a recent joint </span><a href="http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2012/march/07/medicare-fraud-seniors-bills.aspx?referrer=search">Kaiser Health News</a><span style="color:#000000;"> / </span><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/medicare-unveils-new-form-to-enlist-seniors-in-fight-against-fraud/2012/03/06/gIQAy4LqvR_story.html">Washington Post</a><span style="color:#000000;"> article pointed out, we’ve also redesigned the MSN to make it easier for you to help us prevent fraud and find billing errors. Did you know you could get a reward of up to $1,000 for a tip that leads to uncovering fraud? Remember, you’re our best defense against fraud, so check your MSN for services or items you didn’t get.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Here are some of the improvements you’ll see in your new MSN:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         Larger text size and wider spacing to make reading easier</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         Plain, concise language you can understand quickly</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         A “snapshot” of </span>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">   how much of your Part A or Part B deductible you’ve paid so far this year</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">   the providers you saw during the reporting period</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">   whether Medicare approved all your claims</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         Brief descriptions of your medical procedures </span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         Easy-to-understand definitions for terms you might not know</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         A checklist to help you make sure you’re getting the most from your Medicare</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         Information on how to report fraud, preventive medical services, and important Medicare reminders</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         Easy instructions for how to file an appeal</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">You’ll start seeing these changes in early 2013 in the mailed copy of your MSN, but why wait? Visit </span><a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/"><span style="color:#800080;">MyMedicare.gov</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"> and start using the newly redesigned MSN online today.</span></p>

      <p>Many people could be saving money on premiums and prescriptions, and don’t even know it. Recently, a 90-year-old woman in Oklahoma came to her local State Health Insurance Counseling and Assistance Program (SHIP) because she was unable to pay for her prescriptions and her Medicare Part D premium.</p>
<p>A counselor at the SHIP helped her apply for Extra Help and found her a new Part D plan that better fit her needs. Now she spends no money on her premium and very little on her prescriptions – saving her thousands of dollars over the course of the year. She is just one of many people that can save money – and you could be one too.</p>
<p><strong>Medicare Savings Programs</strong></p>
<p>If your monthly income is less than $1,277 ($1,723 as a couple), you may be able to save money with these 4 different Medicare Savings Programs that help pay for premiums and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) Program</li>
<li>Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB)</li>
<li>Qualified Individual (QI) Program</li>
<li>Qualified Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWI)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each program has a different monthly income limit – <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx">get more information about the 2012 limits</a> and how to find out if you qualify.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Help</strong></p>
<p>Many people with limited income and resources may qualify for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx">Medicare’s “Extra Help” program</a>, but they must apply to find out. You could be one of them. You may qualify if you have up to $16,755 in yearly income ($22,695 for a married couple) and up to $13,070 in resources ($26,120 for a married couple). <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx#LowIncomeSubsidy">Get more information about Medicare’s “Extra Help” program</a>.</p>
<p>You can get help with Part D prescription drug coverage premiums, deductibles and copayments. This means you don’t have to go without medications because you can’t afford them, and can get help just like our 90-year-old friend in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>It’s easy and free to <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/i1020/start">apply for “Extra Help.”</a></p>
<p>Save money, live well, and share the information.</p>
