      <p><span style="color:#000000;">It’s a whole lot easier to read and understand your </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/glossary/m.html#msn">Medicare Summary Notice</a><span style="color:#000000;"> (MSN), thanks to a recently completed redesign. You’ll see a brand new format when you check your MSN at </span><a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/"><span style="color:#800080;">MyMedicare.gov</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/"><span style="color:#800080;">MyMedicare.gov</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"> gives you faster access to your Medicare claims information—you can check it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Customize your MSN to see procedures broken down by single claim, or by a time period you choose, and print out your own statement anytime. Reviewing your MSN online means a shorter wait to see what you were charged for health care services, medical supplies or equipment, and how much Medicare paid.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">We want the MSN to be something that makes it easier for you to find and understand your Medicare claims information.  We spent more than a year improving it. We did one-one-one interviews and focus groups with people like you, and used their feedback to improve the design and language.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">As a recent joint </span><a href="http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2012/march/07/medicare-fraud-seniors-bills.aspx?referrer=search">Kaiser Health News</a><span style="color:#000000;"> / </span><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/medicare-unveils-new-form-to-enlist-seniors-in-fight-against-fraud/2012/03/06/gIQAy4LqvR_story.html">Washington Post</a><span style="color:#000000;"> article pointed out, we’ve also redesigned the MSN to make it easier for you to help us prevent fraud and find billing errors. Did you know you could get a reward of up to $1,000 for a tip that leads to uncovering fraud? Remember, you’re our best defense against fraud, so check your MSN for services or items you didn’t get.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Here are some of the improvements you’ll see in your new MSN:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         Larger text size and wider spacing to make reading easier</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         Plain, concise language you can understand quickly</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         A “snapshot” of </span>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">   how much of your Part A or Part B deductible you’ve paid so far this year</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">   the providers you saw during the reporting period</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">   whether Medicare approved all your claims</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         Brief descriptions of your medical procedures </span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         Easy-to-understand definitions for terms you might not know</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         A checklist to help you make sure you’re getting the most from your Medicare</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         Information on how to report fraud, preventive medical services, and important Medicare reminders</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">         Easy instructions for how to file an appeal</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">You’ll start seeing these changes in early 2013 in the mailed copy of your MSN, but why wait? Visit </span><a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/"><span style="color:#800080;">MyMedicare.gov</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"> and start using the newly redesigned MSN online today.</span></p>

      <p>Many people could be saving money on premiums and prescriptions, and don’t even know it. Recently, a 90-year-old woman in Oklahoma came to her local State Health Insurance Counseling and Assistance Program (SHIP) because she was unable to pay for her prescriptions and her Medicare Part D premium.</p>
<p>A counselor at the SHIP helped her apply for Extra Help and found her a new Part D plan that better fit her needs. Now she spends no money on her premium and very little on her prescriptions – saving her thousands of dollars over the course of the year. She is just one of many people that can save money – and you could be one too.</p>
<p><strong>Medicare Savings Programs</strong></p>
<p>If your monthly income is less than $1,277 ($1,723 as a couple), you may be able to save money with these 4 different Medicare Savings Programs that help pay for premiums and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) Program</li>
<li>Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB)</li>
<li>Qualified Individual (QI) Program</li>
<li>Qualified Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWI)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each program has a different monthly income limit – <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx">get more information about the 2012 limits</a> and how to find out if you qualify.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Help</strong></p>
<p>Many people with limited income and resources may qualify for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx">Medicare’s “Extra Help” program</a>, but they must apply to find out. You could be one of them. You may qualify if you have up to $16,755 in yearly income ($22,695 for a married couple) and up to $13,070 in resources ($26,120 for a married couple). <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx#LowIncomeSubsidy">Get more information about Medicare’s “Extra Help” program</a>.</p>
<p>You can get help with Part D prescription drug coverage premiums, deductibles and copayments. This means you don’t have to go without medications because you can’t afford them, and can get help just like our 90-year-old friend in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>It’s easy and free to <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/i1020/start">apply for “Extra Help.”</a></p>
<p>Save money, live well, and share the information.</p>

      <p>Medicare fraud affects everyone. You can team up with Medicare to help.</p>
<p>Our Senior Medicare Patrol volunteers are teaching people like you how to spot, report, and stop fraud, and protect themselves from identity theft.</p>
<p>Here are some things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers. <strong>Treat them like you would treat your credit cards</strong>.</li>
<li>Hang up the phone if someone calls and asks for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information. We will <strong>NEVER</strong> call and ask for this information, and we will <strong>NEVER</strong> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.</li>
<li>Be suspicious of anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number. <strong>It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!</strong></li>
<li>Do not let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare ID card or your identity.</li>
<li>Check your Medicare claims for errors. Look at your Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) or statements from your Medicare plan. You can also check <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">www.MyMedicare.gov </a>or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) as soon as your claims have been processed. The sooner you see and report errors, the sooner we can stop fraud. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.</li>
<li>Call 1-800-MEDICARE to report any suspected fraud.</li>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">As part of National Consumer Protection Week, the Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), Marilyn Tavenner, announced the redesign of the statement that informs Medicare beneficiaries about their claims for Medicare services and benefits.  The redesigned statement, known as the Medicare Summary Notice (MSN), will be available online and, starting in 2013, mailed out quarterly to beneficiaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">This MSN redesign is part of a new initiative, “Your Medicare Information: Clearer, Simpler, At Your Fingertips,” which aims to make Medicare information clearer, more accessible, and easier for beneficiaries and their caregivers to understand.  CMS will take additional actions this year to make information about benefits, providers, and claims more accessible and easier to understand for seniors and people with disabilities who have Medicare.  This MSN redesign reflects more than 18 months of research and feedback from beneficiaries to provide enhanced customer service and respond to suggestions and input.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">“Consumer protection starts with making sure consumers not only get timely and accurate information, but that they understand what services they’re receiving from Medicare,” said Acting Administrator Tavenner.  “The new Medicare Summary Notice empowers Medicare’s seniors and people with disabilities.  The statement is easier to understand and navigate, and makes clear what information to check and how to report potential fraud.  The new MSN also makes it easier for people with Medicare to understand their benefits and file appeals if a claim is denied.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">To see a side-by-side comparison of the former and redesigned MSNs, please visit:</span> <a href="http://www.cms.gov/apps/files/msn_changes.pdf"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">http://www.cms.gov/apps/files/msn_changes.pdf</span></a> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">The redesign of the MSN includes several features not currently available to Medicare beneficiaries with the current MSN:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">A clear notice on how to check the form for important facts and potential fraud;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">An easy-to-understand snapshot of the beneficiary’s deductible status, a list of providers they saw, and whether their claims for Medicare services were approved.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Clearer language, including consumer-friendly descriptions for medical procedures;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Definitions of all terms used in the form;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Larger fonts throughout to make it easier to read;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Information on preventive services available to Medicare beneficiaries.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Starting later this week, the redesigned MSN will be available to beneficiaries on mymedicare.gov, Medicare’s secure online service for personalized information regarding Medicare benefits and services; and, in early 2013, paper copies of the redesigned MSN will start to replace the current version being mailed.</span></p>

      <p><em>By Marilyn Tavenner, Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)</em></p>
<p>Each day, you make decisions about your finances, health, privacy, and more. It’s important to protect yourself and make the best choices for you, especially when it comes to your Medicare.</p>
<p>During National Consumer Protection Week (NCPW), non-profit organizations and government agencies give people like you information on how to take advantage of your rights and make better-informed choices. At Medicare, we’re here to help you become an informed Medicare consumer. Here are 5 things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Know your rights. </strong>As a person with Medicare, you have certain <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11534.pdf">rights and protections</a> designed to help protect you and make sure you get the health care services the law says you can get.</li>
<li><strong>Protect your identity.</strong> Identity theft happens when someone uses your personal information without your consent to commit fraud or other crimes. Keep the following personal information safe:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>Your Social Security number</li>
<li>Your Medicare number (or your membership card if you’re in a Medicare Advantage or other Medicare health plan)</li>
<li>Your credit card and bank account numbers</li>
</ul>
<p>Get more information on how to <a href="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/preventfraud/index.html">protect yourself from identity theft</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Help fight Medicare fraud.</strong> Medicare fraud diverts money from the Medicare program each year, which means higher health care costs for you. Learn how to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/help-and-support/fraud-and-abuse/fraud-and-abuse-overview.aspx">spot and report fraud</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Get involved with other seniors with the Senior Medicare Patrol (SMP). </strong><a href="http://www.smpresource.org/">The SMP</a> educates and empowers people with Medicare to take an active role in detecting and preventing health care fraud and abuse.</li>
<li><strong>Make informed Medicare choices. </strong>Each year during the fall Open Enrollment Period (October 15-December 7), review your plan to make sure it’s going to meet your needs for the following year. If you’re not satisfied with your current plan, you can switch during the Open Enrollment Period.<strong></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.ncpw.gov/">NCPW</a> to learn more about the campaign, see which agencies and organizations are able to help you, and to find out if there are any NCPW activities happening in your area.</p>
