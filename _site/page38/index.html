      <p><em>﻿﻿﻿By Don Berwick, M.D., Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Crossposted from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/">﻿HealthCare.gov</a></em></p>
<p>If you or a loved one has ever had the unfortunate experience of having a chronic or serious illness, you’ve experienced the frustration of our fragmented health care system. Just when you are feeling your worst, there you are in the doctor’s office or hospital room, repeating the same information time and time again, sitting through the same medical test more than once, and trying to track down lost or unavailable medical charts. These are all aspects of our current health care system we could each do without.</p>
<p>This can be a particular problem for the more than half of Medicare beneficiaries with five or more chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, and kidney disease. These patients often receive care from multiple physicians and in multiple sites. A failure to coordinate care can lead to patients not getting the care they need or receiving duplicative care. This lack of coordination also increases their risk of suffering medical errors, such as receiving prescriptions for medications that ought not to be taken together. It can also cause complications that lead to needless hospital stays. Nearly one in five Medicare patients discharged from the hospital is readmitted within 30 days – a readmission many patients could have avoided if their care outside of the hospital had been better coordinated.</p>
<p>Improving coordination and communication among physicians and other providers and suppliers will help improve the care Medicare beneficiaries receive, while also helping lower costs. Numerous studies have shown that better care often costs less, because coordinated care helps to ensure that the patient receives the right care at the right time.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today released proposed new rules to help doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers better coordinate care for Medicare patients through Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). ACOs are designed to create and support a team of health care providers who treat individual patients by working together across care settings.</p>
<p>Over the last months, CMS has conducted extensive outreach to patient advocates, doctors, nurses, hospitals, health plans, employers, and other interested stakeholders to hear their thinking about the best way to shape this effort. We will continue to seek feedback on the proposed rules released today so that the final rules reflect the broadest consensus on how to improve care for people with Medicare and to provide a model for private payers to draw upon. We look forward to working with patients and care providers to build the most patient friendly and cost-effective health care system achievable</p>
<p>Under the proposal, ACO teams of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers and suppliers working together would coordinate and improve care for patients with Original Medicare. ACOs would have to meet high quality standards in five key areas:</p>
<p>•Patient/Caregiver Experience of Care<br />
•Care Coordination<br />
•Patient Safety<br />
•Preventive Health<br />
•At Risk Population/Frail Elderly Health</p>
<p>An ACO will be rewarded for providing better care and investing in bettering the health and lives of patients. ACOs are not just a new way to pay for care. They are a new model for the organization and delivery of care. Accountable Care Organizations are designed to lift the burden of fragmented and disconnected care from patients, while improving the partnership among patients, doctors, hospitals and other providers of care in making health care decisions.</p>

      <p><em>By Donald Berwick, M.D., Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</em></p>
<p>If you’re new to Medicare, take charge of your health and wellness with a thorough physical exam.</p>
<p>Getting an in-depth physical exam is a smart and easy way for you and your doctor to set a starting point for your personalized health care. It’s your roadmap for effective, efficient and timely health care, and it will help lower our healthcare system’s per-person costs.</p>
<p>Medicare covers two types of physical exams—one when you’re new to Medicare and one each year after that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/welcometomedicare/landing.html"><strong>"Welcome to Medicare" physical exam</strong></a><strong></strong></p>
<p>Medicare covers a one-time <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/welcometomedicare/landing.html">"Welcome to Medicare" physical exam</a> if  you get it within the first 12 months you have Part B.  Beginning in 2011, you can get this exam for free if your doctor accepts assignment.</p>
<p>Your comprehensive “Welcome to Medicare” physical exam includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A      review of your medical and social history including risk factors you can      change</li>
<li>A      physical exam that includes measuring your height, weight, blood pressure,      visual acuity screen, and body mass index</li>
<li>Education,      counseling, and referrals based on the results of your physical exam</li>
<li>A      brief written plan, such as a checklist, for getting appropriate screening      and/or other Medicare Part B preventive services</li>
<li>A      review of your potential risk factors for depression</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="links to the medicare physical exam page at medicare.gov" href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/medicare-physical-exam.aspx"><strong>Yearly “wellness” exam</strong></a></p>
<p>Thanks to the new healthcare law, Medicare also covers a  yearly “wellness” exam (once you’ve had Part B for longer than 12 months and if it has been at least 12 months from your “Welcome to Medicare” physical examination) which will help you develop or update a prevention plan, based on your current health and risk factors. You’ll pay nothing for the exam as long as your doctor accepts assignment (agrees to be paid directly by Medicare and accepts the amount Medicare approves for the service).</p>
<p>So get the most from your new Medicare benefits and stay in control of your health: Don’t delay.  Schedule your physical exam today!</p>

      <p><em>By Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services<br />
</em></p>
<p>It’s important to protect the high-quality health care currently available to people with Medicare.  Unfortunately, the 23% cut in Medicare payments to doctors that is scheduled to go into effect at the end of November has the potential to disrupt the health care that millions of Medicare beneficiaries rely on.</p>
<p>Today, in a speech to the Association of American Medical Colleges, I spoke about why this Administration has made it a priority to ensure this extreme cut in payments to doctors is addressed during the upcoming Congressional session. Here’s an excerpt from my speech:</p>
<blockquote><p>“…[We] know that health care providers also face significant barriers as you strive to deliver the best care possible.  And we’re committed to working with you to reduce them.</p>
<p>That starts with preventing the 23% cut in Medicare payments to doctors that’s scheduled to take effect at the end of the month. These drastic cuts could force doctors out of the Medicare program and jeopardize the care of our seniors.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I attended a Cabinet meeting where the President stressed that preventing these potentially disastrous cuts must be one of our top priorities. The American Medical Association has proposed a 13 month extension.  And I hope that Congress will act quickly to pass it, so that our doctors and seniors can have some peace of mind while we work on a long-term fix.</p>
<p>There’s been a lot of talk in the last few months about Medicare and its future. The single biggest step we can take to strengthen Medicare for seniors and disabled Americans is to make sure these disruptive cuts don’t take effect.</p>
<p>As the President has said many times, we will ultimately need a permanent fix, so that the livelihoods of the hard-working doctors who care for seniors and people with disabilities are no longer subject to politics. But in the meantime, we don’t want any doctor to be stuck in a limbo where they don’t know week to week how much they’ll be paid for the services they deliver.</p>
<p>That’s why we’re urging Congress to act now to make sure that you can continue to provide the high quality care our seniors depend on every day.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Strengthening Medicare is a core value for this Administration. We will continue to act to ensure that the program and the people who receive care and provide care have the resources they need.

      <p><em>By Don Berwick, M.D., Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services<br />
</em><br />
By now, everyone knows that smoking and tobacco use just aren’t good for you.  But that knowledge can be very abstract.  If it isn’t apparent that tobacco use is hurting you now, why quit?</p>
<p>Well, anyone who has ever battled lung cancer or lived with emphysema – or watched a loved one experience those conditions – knows that the consequences of smoking and tobacco aren’t abstract at all. And some people don't know that tobacco is a major risk factor for heart disease, just as it is for cancer.</p>
<p>So, when I tell you that almost half a million people have died from tobacco use in the past year, that probably seems abstract too.  (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/" title="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/"><span title="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/">estimates that cigarette smoking alone is responsible for 443,000 deaths per year</span></a>.)</p>
<p>Think of it this way: that is six times as many people as attended the Super Bowl last year. </p>
<p>While it isn’t a new thing to say that tobacco is bad for your health, it is new for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1" title="http://www.medicare.gov/Default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1"><span title="http://www.medicare.gov/Default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1">Medicare</span></a> to <a href="http://www.cms.gov/apps/media/press/release.asp?Counter=3830&amp;intNumPerPage=10&amp;checkDate=&amp;checkKey=&amp;srchType=1&amp;numDays=3500&amp;srchOpt=0&amp;srchData=&amp;keywordType=All&amp;chkNewsType=1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5&amp;intPage=&amp;showAll=&amp;pYear=&amp;year=&amp;desc=&amp;cboOrder=date" title="http://www.cms.gov/apps/media/press/release.asp?Counter=3830&amp;intNumPerPage=10&amp;checkDate=&amp;checkKey=&amp;srchType=1&amp;numDays=3500&amp;srchOpt=0&amp;srchData=&amp;keywordType=All&amp;chkNewsType=1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5&amp;intPage=&amp;showAll=&amp;pYear=&amp;year=&amp;desc=&amp;cboOrder=date"><span title="http://www.cms.gov/apps/media/press/release.asp?Counter=3830&amp;intNumPerPage=10&amp;checkDate=&amp;checkKey=&amp;srchType=1&amp;numDays=3500&amp;srchOpt=0&amp;srchData=&amp;keywordType=All&amp;chkNewsType=1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5&amp;intPage=&amp;showAll=&amp;pYear=&amp;year=&amp;desc=&amp;cboOrder=date">pay for a smoker or tobacco user to get cessation counseling</span></a> <i>before</i> they have symptoms of resulting disease.</p>
<p>Today, under a <a href="http://www.cms.gov/center/coverage.asp" title="http://www.cms.gov/center/coverage.asp"><span title="http://www.cms.gov/center/coverage.asp">new coverage decision</span></a>, anyone who smokes or uses tobacco and is covered by Medicare will be able to receive tobacco cessation counseling from a qualified physician or other Medicare-recognized practitioner who can work with them to help them quit.  (All people with Medicare will continue to have access to tobacco cessation prescription medication through the Medicare Prescription Drug Program.)</p>
<p>For the estimated 5.5 million people with Medicare who are smokers and may be looking to quit, the new benefit lowers a potential barrier to treatment. <a href="http://www.smokefree.gov/" title="http://www.smokefree.gov/"><span title="http://www.smokefree.gov/">Quitting</span></a> reduces the risk of death from coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, or lung or other cancers.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><em>By Jonathan Blum, Deputy Administrator and Director for the Center of Medicare at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service</em>s</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A number of visitors to <a href="http://www.HealthCare.gov">www.HealthCare.gov</a> have told us they’d like to know more about the Medicare “donut hole” in the Part D program.</p>
<p>If you aren’t familiar with <a href="http://www. Medicare.gov">Medicare</a>, it is a health insurance program for people 65 or older, people under 65 with certain disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure). People with Medicare have the option of paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. This prescription drug coverage is called Medicare Part D.</p>
<p>In 2010, basic Medicare Part D coverage works like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You pay out-of-pocket for monthly Part D premiums all year.</li>
<li>You pay 100% of your drug costs until you reach the $310 deductible amount.</li>
<li>After reaching the deductible, you pay 25% of the cost of your drugs, while the Part D plan pays the rest, until the total you and your plan spend on your drugs reaches $2,800.</li>
<li>Once you reach this limit, you have hit the coverage gap referred to as the “donut hole,” and you are now responsible for the full cost of your drugs until the total you have spent for your drugs reaches the yearly out-of-pocket spending limit of $4,550.</li>
<li>After this yearly spending limit, you are only responsible for a small amount of the cost, usually 5% of the cost of your drugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have read in the 2<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/10050.pdf">010 Medicare &amp; You Handbook</a> that there are some Medicare Part D plans that offer coverage in the donut hole---but these plans may charge a higher monthly premium. (There are also some Part D plans that are “enhanced” and offer fixed co-pays (for example $5, $10, and $20) for prescription drugs instead of the deductible and 25% cost-sharing that was described above. These plans also may charge a higher monthly premium.)</p>
<p>For those that qualify, there is also a program called Medicare Extra Help that helps you pay your premiums and have reduced or no out-of-pocket costs for your drugs.</p>
<p>Needless to say, for most people with Medicare Part D, the donut hole presents serious financial challenges. Some people have had to choose between their rent or groceries and their prescription drugs.</p>
<p>But, the recent health reform law - the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11464.pdf">Affordable Care Act</a> - has some important changes that will help to relieve this burden for the people with Medicare that hit the donut hole each year (and are not already on a program called Medicare Extra Help,):</p>
<ul>
<li>This year, if you enter the Part D donut hole, you will receive a <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/moredonutchecks.html">one-time, $250 rebate check</a>. The mailing of these checks <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/moredonutchecks.html">began in June</a>. If you are eligible and do not receive your check, call your Part D plan first and then 1-800-Medicare.</li>
<li>Starting in 2011, you will receive a 50% discount on brand-name drugs in the donut hole, and you will start to pay less and less for your generic Part D drugs in the donut hole.</li>
<li>Starting in 2013, you will pay less and less for your brand-name Part D prescription drugs in the donut hole.</li>
<li>By 2020, the coverage gap will be closed, meaning there will be no more “donut hole,” and you will only pay 25% of the costs of your drugs until you reach the yearly out-of-pocket spending limit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this time, you will get continuous Medicare Part D coverage for your prescription drugs as long as you are on a prescription drug plan.</p>
<p>If you would like more information on the one-time rebate check, feel free to check out <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11464.pdf">this brochure</a> or call 1-800-MEDICARE. (Please note that you do not need to do anything to receive this rebate check and should not provide any personal information such as Medicare, Social Security or bank account numbers to anyone calling about the rebate.)</p>
