      <p>By Karen Pollitz, Director for Consumer Support, CCIIO. Cross-post from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/consumerprotections03312011.html">Healthcare.gov</a></p>
<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/Consumerprotections03302011.html">I wrote about </a>the Schley family who experienced first-hand the new consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act. There are a number of provisions that will move us towards a fairer, more affordable health insurance system — including <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/billofright/patient_bill_of_rights.html">the Patient’s Bill of Rights</a>.</p>
<p>Because of health care reform, insurance companies:</p>
<p>•Can no longer deny coverage to children younger than 19 because of a <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/ChildrensPCIP/childrenspcip.html">pre-existing condition </a>(Protection for adults will go into effect in 2014).<br />
•Can’t take away your coverage based on an unintentional mistake you or your employer made on an application (also known as <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/Curbing%20Insurance%20Cancellations/cancellations.html">rescission of health coverage</a>.).<br />
•Must allow most <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/youngadult/index.html">children up to age 26 </a>to stay on or be added to their parents’ family health plan.<br />
•Must stop putting <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/limits/limits.html">lifetime dollar limits on coverage </a>(annual dollar limits are being phased out between now and 2014.)<br />
•Must provide <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/choice_access/index.html">consumers their choice of any available primary care doctor </a>or pediatrician in a plan’s network.<br />
•Must ensure access to out-of-network <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/choice_access/index.html">emergency care </a>without prior authorization or higher cost sharing that would otherwise be charged.<br />
•Must meet certain basic standards when they review a consumer’s appeal of a denied claim. (The law also strengthens consumers’ rights to an independent “external” review when an insurer’s “internal review” upholds a claims denial.)<br />
For most consumers, these protections kicked in sometime over the past few months at the start of a new plan or policy year. (Some plans in place when the Affordable Care Act was passed in March 2010 were “grandfathered” or exempt from some – but not all provisions. Always check with your plan or employer to find out if your plan is grandfathered.)</p>
<p>The consumer protections were designed to fix some of the most unfair practices of health insurers.</p>
<p>Congressional hearings in 2009, for example, shone a spot light on questionable rescissions in which insurance companies were cancelling coverage even when mistakes were unintentional or caused by other people. The primary care doctor provision was enacted because studies show that patients tend to experience better quality health care if they have long-term relationships with their health care provider. Other protections will improve the likelihood that children and young adults will get timely and appropriate health care services to be healthier, more productive adults down the road.</p>

<p>During the past year, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, some of us have personally experienced just how important the consumer protections—and other provisions-- are in addressing some of the most glaring problems in the insurance marketplace.</p>
<p>Among those celebrating the Affordable Care Act’s birthday is the Schley family of Circleville, New York. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, David and Patricia’s 23 year-old-daughter, who was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, was added to the family health insurance plan. But before their daughter could be added to the family health plan in January 2011, she needed coverage for the month before the dependent coverage provision became effective. Patricia and David read about the New York program for covering people with a pre-existing condition in the newspaper—a program that is now available in every state in the country as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Patricia next tapped into another resource that was available through the Affordable Care Act—the <a href="http://cciio.cms.gov/programs/consumer/index.html">Consumer Assistance Program (CAP)</a> in New York that provides case workers to help with insurance problems and questions. A caseworker in New York’s Consumer Assistance Program helped the family get the short-term coverage they needed in a timely manner. “Having a sick child, at any age, is stressful enough,” Patricia Schley said, but if your child in uninsured and the treatment for a condition like Crohn’s disease can cost up to $800 a month—having “to worry about how you’re going to pay for one bill after another only adds to the stress.”</p>
<p>For the Schley’s, the Affordable Care Act served up a “triple play” of protections, in the words of Elisabeth Benjamin, Vice President of Health Initiatives with the Community Service Society, which runs the Consumer Assistance Program through 25 community-based organizations across New York. The triple play included: access to the new <a href="https://www.pcip.gov/">Pre-existing Condition Insurance Program (PCIP)</a>, coverage for adult children who are under 26, and the strengthening of Consumer Assistance Programs (CAP) through federal grants to a number of states and territories—including New York.</p>
<p>We may not all need a “triple play” to resolve a health insurance problem. But even a “single” play can resolve some problems that can be devastating. Just ask the 100 million Americans whose health insurance coverage imposed lifetime dollar limits before they were prohibited under the Affordable Care Act. Or the estimated 2 to 4 million individuals who faced high out-of-pocket spending when they used out-of-network emergency care providers before consumer protections were enacted.</p>
<p>Over the next couple of days, I’ll be writing in more detail about the new consumer protections and services, including the ones that helped the Schleys. Please check back to find out more about how these can help you and your family.</p>

      <p><em>﻿﻿﻿By Don Berwick, M.D., Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Crossposted from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/">﻿HealthCare.gov</a></em></p>
<p>If you or a loved one has ever had the unfortunate experience of having a chronic or serious illness, you’ve experienced the frustration of our fragmented health care system. Just when you are feeling your worst, there you are in the doctor’s office or hospital room, repeating the same information time and time again, sitting through the same medical test more than once, and trying to track down lost or unavailable medical charts. These are all aspects of our current health care system we could each do without.</p>
<p>This can be a particular problem for the more than half of Medicare beneficiaries with five or more chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, and kidney disease. These patients often receive care from multiple physicians and in multiple sites. A failure to coordinate care can lead to patients not getting the care they need or receiving duplicative care. This lack of coordination also increases their risk of suffering medical errors, such as receiving prescriptions for medications that ought not to be taken together. It can also cause complications that lead to needless hospital stays. Nearly one in five Medicare patients discharged from the hospital is readmitted within 30 days – a readmission many patients could have avoided if their care outside of the hospital had been better coordinated.</p>
<p>Improving coordination and communication among physicians and other providers and suppliers will help improve the care Medicare beneficiaries receive, while also helping lower costs. Numerous studies have shown that better care often costs less, because coordinated care helps to ensure that the patient receives the right care at the right time.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today released proposed new rules to help doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers better coordinate care for Medicare patients through Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). ACOs are designed to create and support a team of health care providers who treat individual patients by working together across care settings.</p>
<p>Over the last months, CMS has conducted extensive outreach to patient advocates, doctors, nurses, hospitals, health plans, employers, and other interested stakeholders to hear their thinking about the best way to shape this effort. We will continue to seek feedback on the proposed rules released today so that the final rules reflect the broadest consensus on how to improve care for people with Medicare and to provide a model for private payers to draw upon. We look forward to working with patients and care providers to build the most patient friendly and cost-effective health care system achievable</p>
<p>Under the proposal, ACO teams of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers and suppliers working together would coordinate and improve care for patients with Original Medicare. ACOs would have to meet high quality standards in five key areas:</p>
<p>•Patient/Caregiver Experience of Care<br />
•Care Coordination<br />
•Patient Safety<br />
•Preventive Health<br />
•At Risk Population/Frail Elderly Health</p>
<p>An ACO will be rewarded for providing better care and investing in bettering the health and lives of patients. ACOs are not just a new way to pay for care. They are a new model for the organization and delivery of care. Accountable Care Organizations are designed to lift the burden of fragmented and disconnected care from patients, while improving the partnership among patients, doctors, hospitals and other providers of care in making health care decisions.</p>

      <p><em>By Donald Berwick, M.D., Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</em></p>
<p>If you’re new to Medicare, take charge of your health and wellness with a thorough physical exam.</p>
<p>Getting an in-depth physical exam is a smart and easy way for you and your doctor to set a starting point for your personalized health care. It’s your roadmap for effective, efficient and timely health care, and it will help lower our healthcare system’s per-person costs.</p>
<p>Medicare covers two types of physical exams—one when you’re new to Medicare and one each year after that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/welcometomedicare/landing.html"><strong>"Welcome to Medicare" physical exam</strong></a><strong></strong></p>
<p>Medicare covers a one-time <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/welcometomedicare/landing.html">"Welcome to Medicare" physical exam</a> if  you get it within the first 12 months you have Part B.  Beginning in 2011, you can get this exam for free if your doctor accepts assignment.</p>
<p>Your comprehensive “Welcome to Medicare” physical exam includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A      review of your medical and social history including risk factors you can      change</li>
<li>A      physical exam that includes measuring your height, weight, blood pressure,      visual acuity screen, and body mass index</li>
<li>Education,      counseling, and referrals based on the results of your physical exam</li>
<li>A      brief written plan, such as a checklist, for getting appropriate screening      and/or other Medicare Part B preventive services</li>
<li>A      review of your potential risk factors for depression</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="links to the medicare physical exam page at medicare.gov" href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/medicare-physical-exam.aspx"><strong>Yearly “wellness” exam</strong></a></p>
<p>Thanks to the new healthcare law, Medicare also covers a  yearly “wellness” exam (once you’ve had Part B for longer than 12 months and if it has been at least 12 months from your “Welcome to Medicare” physical examination) which will help you develop or update a prevention plan, based on your current health and risk factors. You’ll pay nothing for the exam as long as your doctor accepts assignment (agrees to be paid directly by Medicare and accepts the amount Medicare approves for the service).</p>
<p>So get the most from your new Medicare benefits and stay in control of your health: Don’t delay.  Schedule your physical exam today!</p>

      <p><em>By Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services<br />
</em></p>
<p>It’s important to protect the high-quality health care currently available to people with Medicare.  Unfortunately, the 23% cut in Medicare payments to doctors that is scheduled to go into effect at the end of November has the potential to disrupt the health care that millions of Medicare beneficiaries rely on.</p>
<p>Today, in a speech to the Association of American Medical Colleges, I spoke about why this Administration has made it a priority to ensure this extreme cut in payments to doctors is addressed during the upcoming Congressional session. Here’s an excerpt from my speech:</p>
<blockquote><p>“…[We] know that health care providers also face significant barriers as you strive to deliver the best care possible.  And we’re committed to working with you to reduce them.</p>
<p>That starts with preventing the 23% cut in Medicare payments to doctors that’s scheduled to take effect at the end of the month. These drastic cuts could force doctors out of the Medicare program and jeopardize the care of our seniors.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I attended a Cabinet meeting where the President stressed that preventing these potentially disastrous cuts must be one of our top priorities. The American Medical Association has proposed a 13 month extension.  And I hope that Congress will act quickly to pass it, so that our doctors and seniors can have some peace of mind while we work on a long-term fix.</p>
<p>There’s been a lot of talk in the last few months about Medicare and its future. The single biggest step we can take to strengthen Medicare for seniors and disabled Americans is to make sure these disruptive cuts don’t take effect.</p>
<p>As the President has said many times, we will ultimately need a permanent fix, so that the livelihoods of the hard-working doctors who care for seniors and people with disabilities are no longer subject to politics. But in the meantime, we don’t want any doctor to be stuck in a limbo where they don’t know week to week how much they’ll be paid for the services they deliver.</p>
<p>That’s why we’re urging Congress to act now to make sure that you can continue to provide the high quality care our seniors depend on every day.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Strengthening Medicare is a core value for this Administration. We will continue to act to ensure that the program and the people who receive care and provide care have the resources they need.
