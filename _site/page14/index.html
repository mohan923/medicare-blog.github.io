      <p>Do you or does someone you know have high blood pressure? Most likely, your answer is yes. More than one-third of adults in the United States have high blood pressure, and many don’t even know it. High blood pressure increases your risk of heart disease, the #1 killer worldwide, and many other diseases. That’s why it’s important to get your blood pressure checked regularly.</p>
<p>Medicare helps make checking your blood pressure easy. A blood pressure screening is covered in your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/people-like-me/new-to-medicare/welcome-to-medicare-visit.html">“Welcome to Medicare” visit</a> and your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">Yearly Wellness visit</a> at no cost to you.</p>
<p>There are also many ways to prevent and help treat high blood pressure. Eating a healthy diet and avoiding sodium are easy ways to lower blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight and being physically active are also important. The surgeon general recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week. You can also check your blood pressure between your yearly visits for free at many pharmacies, senior centers, and health fairs.</p>
<p>May is National High Blood Pressure Education Month, watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opQFBVd7oHI">our video</a> to learn more.</p>

      <p>Do you keep putting off exercise? You may be hurting your bones. Lack of exercise is one of the risk factors that can lead to osteoporosis. When people have osteoporosis their bones become less dense. You may not know that you have osteoporosis until your bones are so weak that a sudden strain, bump, or fall causes your wrist to break or your hip to fracture.</p>
<p>Medicare can help you prevent or detect osteoporosis at an early stage, when treatment works best. Talk to your doctor about getting a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html">bone mass measurement</a>—it may be free.</p>
<p>May is National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month. Learn more about what puts you at risk for osteoporosis and how to prevent or treat it at the <a href="http://www.nof.org/">National Osteoporosis Foundation</a> or the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/vitamins/calcium.html">Centers for Disease Control</a>. Watch our short <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opQFBVd7oHI">video</a> to learn more about how Medicare can help you protect your bones.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>By Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services</p>
<div id="date_comment_info"><em>Posted March 21, 2013, Crossposted from <a href="http://healthcare.gov/blog" target="_blank">healthcare.gov</a></em></div>
<p>In the three years since the Affordable Care Act became law, the slower growth of health care costs is saving money in Medicare and the private insurance market, helping to curb previously skyrocketing premiums and making Medicare stronger.</p>
<p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that Medicare and Medicaid spending would be 15 percent less -- or about $200 billion— in 2020 than was previously projected, thanks to this slower growth. Medicare spending per beneficiary rose by just 0.4% in 2012, while Medicaid spending per beneficiary actually dropped by 1.9% last year. We are making Medicare stronger, too, by spending smarter, promoting coordinated care, and fighting fraud. Not only does this ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely.  It means that those who count on Medicare -- our grandparents, parents, our friends, and neighbors – will have it for years to come.</p>
<p>Today, we are announcing that thanks to the Affordable Care Act, more than 6.3 million seniors and people with disabilities on Medicare have saved more than $6.1 billion on prescription drugs since the health care law was enacted three years ago. This is the result of the law’s closing of the prescription coverage gap known as “the donut hole.”</p>
<p>Nearly 3.5 million people with Medicare saved an average of more than $706 each on their prescriptions in 2012.</p>
<p>In the case of Helen Rayon of Pennsylvania, the savings on her medications is enough to help her contribute to the education of her grandson. She says: “I take seven different medications. Getting the donut hole closed … gives me a little more money in my pocket.” <a title="My Care: Helen R saves on medications" href="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A289CvcPdDc" target="_blank">Watch a video</a> to learn more about Helen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2012/03/mycare_david.html">David Lutz</a>, a community pharmacist from Hummelstown, PA, described his elderly customers, “splitting pills, taking doses every other day, missing doses, stretching their medications.”  But he says this has begun to change with the savings resulting from the Affordable Care Act, and that’s good for their health as well as their budgets.</p>
<p>After the law was passed, the Affordable Care Act provided a one-time $250 check for people with Medicare who reached the Part D prescription drug coverage gap in 2010. Since then, individuals in the donut hole have continued to receive savings on prescription drugs. In 2013 individuals in the donut hole are saving over 50% off of the cost of branded drugs. The savings on both brand name and generic drugs will continue to increase until the coverage gap is closed in 2020.</p>
<p>Along with savings on their medications, American seniors have also benefited from access to vital preventive services -- such as mammograms, cholesterol checks, cancer screenings, and annual wellness visits -- with no Part B coinsurance or deductibles. In 2012, <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2013/02/aca-saves-seniors-billions.html">more than 34 million seniors and people with disabilities with Medicare</a> received at least one free preventive service. Having easier access to preventive services without worrying about the cost helps seniors stay healthier and identify health conditions before they become more serious and costly.</p>
<p>Helen works as a health-and-wellness coordinator at a senior center, arranging for health and fitness activities for seniors older than herself.  She knows they struggle with the costs of staying healthy. “If it weren’t for the health care reform, many of our seniors would not get to a doctor,” to get a check up, Helen says. “It is expensive for us to keep good health.”</p>
<p>Affordable Care Act initiatives are also ensuring that if Medicare beneficiaries do end up in the hospital that their care is coordinated and they stay out of the hospital once they’re discharged. This also gives Medicare beneficiaries – and other taxpayers – more value for their health care dollars. In fact, hospital readmissions in Medicare have fallen for the first time on record, resulting in 70,000 fewer readmissions in the last half of 2012.</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act is helping us keep our moral commitment to ensure that our grandparents and other seniors get the high-quality, affordable health care and security they need and deserve.</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>The onset of spring is a reminder of new beginnings - the longer hours of daylight, sprouting tulips and warmer weather are all indicators of a new season, and a new reason to be proactive with your health.  One simple way to manage your health is to practice preventive care. Because preventive services can find health problems early, when treatment works best, it’s a crucial step in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p><b>Your Preventive Services with Medicare</b></p>
<p>If you have Medicare, then you have access to a variety of preventive tests and screenings, most at no cost to you. If you’re new to Medicare, your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">“Welcome to Medicare”</a> preventive visit is now covered for free during your first 12 months of Part B coverage. This visit includes a review of your medical and social history related to your health and education and counseling about preventive services, including certain screenings, shots, and referrals for other care, if needed.</p>
<p>If you’ve had Part B for longer than 12 months, you can get a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly wellness visit</a> to develop or update a personalized prevention plan based on your current health and risk factors.  In addition to these important wellness visits, Medicare covers screening tests for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-screenings.html">diabetes</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/colorectal-cancer-screenings.html">colon cancer</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/mammograms.html">breast cancer</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html">osteoporosis</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cardiovascular-disease-screenings.html">heart disease</a>, just to name a few.</p>
<p>So as you tend to your garden this spring, make a commitment to tend to yourself too. Practice <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive care</a> to ensure you stay healthy, live longer, and delay or prevent many diseases.</p>
