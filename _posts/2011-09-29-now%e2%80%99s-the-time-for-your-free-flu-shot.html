<p>Flu season is upon us—did you know it can start as early as October? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered.</p>
<p>Get your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/flu-shots.aspx">flu shot</a> now—it’s free for people with Medicare, once per flu season in the fall or winter, when given by doctors or other health care providers (such as senior centers and pharmacies) that take Medicare.</p>
<p>Stay healthy this flu season and help protect your loved ones. Get your flu shot early!</p>
