<li>Guard your information.</li>
<li>Be wary of giveaways.</li>
<li>Don’t lend your identity.</li>
<li>If you spot something, say something</li>
</ol>
<p>These are 4 simple ways to protect your identity and personal information from Medicare fraud, but they can be difficult to do if you’re caught off guard. </p>
<p>During Medicare Open Enrollment - between now and December 7 - you can expect to hear a lot about the <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/03/medicare-open-enrollment-medicare-is-stronger-than-ever/"><span style="color:#003399;">choices, benefits, and lower costs</span></a> you have when it comes to Medicare.</p>
<p>Open Enrollment is a great time for you to review and compare your Medicare choices and make you have the coverage that fits your needs. Unfortunately, it’s also a popular time for Medicare fraud schemes. </p>
<p>During Open Enrollment, you’ll find Medicare information all around you <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2011/10/11/medicare-open-enrollment-4-places-to-look-for-medicare-information/"><span style="color:#003399;">– in the mail, on TV, in the paper, and on your computer</span></a>.  Here are a few reminders to keep you safe from those who might not have your best interests in mind:    </p>
<p><strong>1.    </strong><strong>Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers – treat them like you’d treat your credit cards. </strong></p>
<p>You’ll be hearing so much about Medicare during Open Enrollment, that it may not surprise you to get phone calls or visits to your house from people selling Medicare plans. </p>
<p>It’s illegal for someone to call and ask for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information.  A Medicare representative or a private insurance plan working with Medicare will <strong>never</strong> call and ask for this information, and we will <strong>never</strong> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.  If a sales agent does call or visit you uninvited they are violating the Medicare marketing rules.</p>
<p><strong>2.    Be suspicious of people offering free medical equipment or services.</strong></p>
<p> Anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number is tricking you – if it’s really free, they don’t need your Medicare number. It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!</p>
<p><strong>3.    </strong><strong>Don’t let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare card or your personal information.</strong></p>
<p>If someone asks you for your Medicare number, stop and think. If you wouldn’t feel comfortable giving that person your credit card number, <strong>don’t</strong> give them your Medicare number. </p>
<p><strong>4.   Most importantly, if you suspect Medicare fraud, let us know!</strong> Call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227).</p>
<p>Medicare is stronger than ever, and we need your help to keep it that way. The health care law is doing a lot to help us fight Medicare fraud and make America stronger, safer, and healthier. </p>
