<p> “Risky drinking” is defined as more than 21 drinks per month according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the American Geriatrics Society. Did you know that 9% of people with Medicare drink more than 30 drinks a month?</p>
<p>There are lots of changes that happen with age, and some of them, like physical pain, loss of mobility, and loneliness can lead to alcohol misuse.  Drinking too much alcohol increases your risk of injuries, violence, drowning, liver disease, bad interactions with medications, and some types of cancer. </p>
<p>April is Alcohol Awareness Month, and it’s the perfect time to remind you that Medicare covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/alcohol-counseling.html">alcohol misuse screening &amp; counselling</a> to provide counselling for people who misuse alcohol.</p>
