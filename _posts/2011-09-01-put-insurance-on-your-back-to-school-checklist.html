<p>Pencils, backpack, lunch box? All covered. How about health insurance?</p>
<p>If you’re one of the millions of hard-working families without health insurance, there’s great news: the <a href="http://www.insurekidsnow.gov/"><strong>Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)</strong></a> covers more kids than ever. CHIP offers low-cost or free health insurance for babies, children, and teens, even if you’re working or you’ve been turned down by state programs before.</p>
<p>CHIP pays for doctor visits, prescriptions, and hospitalizations. Most states also cover dental care, eye care, and medical equipment. What you pay depends on your state and your income, but many services are free, and charges for others are small.</p>
<p><strong>Protect Your Child’s Health &amp; Future</strong></p>
<p>With coverage through CHIP, you can see a doctor when your child gets sick, without having to worry about how you’ll pay for it. Your kids can get the shots and well-child visits they need to attend school and play sports. </p>
<p>The fact is, children with health insurance are more likely to be healthier and miss fewer school days. When they do get sick, you won't have to sit for hours in the emergency room for conditions that could be easily treated in your doctor's office. </p>
<p><strong>Applying for CHIP Is Easy &amp; Free</strong></p>
<p>In most states, you can complete a short application through the mail or over the phone. Visit <a href="http://www.insurekidsnow.gov/"><strong>insurekidsnow.gov</strong></a>, or make a free call to <strong>1-877-KIDS-NOW (1-877-543-7669).  </strong></p>
<p>Many families think they make too much money to qualify, but you’d be surprised. If you’re a grandparent or legal guardian, many states also let you apply for the children in your care.</p>
