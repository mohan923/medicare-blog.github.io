<p><span style="color:#000000;">The start of spring is a reminder of new beginnings – the longer hours of daylight, sprouting tulips and warmer weather are all indicators of a new season, and a new reason to be proactive with your health. One simple way to manage your health is to practice preventive care. Because preventive services can find health problems early, when treatment works best, it’s a crucial step in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><b>Your preventive services with Medicare</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">If you have Medicare, then you have access to a variety of preventive tests and screenings, most at no cost to you. If you’re new to Medicare, your </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">“Welcome to Medicare”</a><span style="color:#000000;"> preventive visit is now covered for free during your first 12 months of Part B coverage. This visit includes a review of your medical and social history related to your health and education and counseling about preventive services, including certain screenings, shots, and referrals for other care, if needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">If you’ve had Part B for longer than 12 months, you can get a </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly wellness visit</a><span style="color:#000000;"> to develop or update a personalized prevention plan based on your current health and risk factors. In addition to these important wellness visits, Medicare covers screening tests for </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-screenings.html">diabetes</a><span style="color:#000000;">, </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/colorectal-cancer-screenings.html">colon cancer</a><span style="color:#000000;">, </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/mammograms.html">breast cancer</a><span style="color:#000000;">, </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html">osteoporosis</a><span style="color:#000000;"> and </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cardiovascular-disease-screenings.html">heart disease</a><span style="color:#000000;">, just to name a few.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">So as you tend to your garden this spring, make a commitment to tend to yourself too. Practice </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive care</a><span style="color:#000000;"> so you can you stay healthy, live longer, and delay or prevent many diseases.</span></p>
