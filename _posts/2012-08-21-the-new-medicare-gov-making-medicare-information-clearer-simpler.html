<p>Did you notice something new today? Medicare.gov has a new design that makes it faster and easier for you to answer your Medicare questions.</p>
<p>We know Medicare.gov is your trusted source of online Medicare information.  That’s why we worked more than 2 years improving the things you use most. We did interviews and focus groups with people like you and the people who help you with your Medicare questions to help us find out what matters most to you. And, we used that feedback to make the website better.</p>
<p>The new Medicare.gov includes features not available before, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many ways for you to do the most common tasks, like finding out about costs, coverage, and plans, through several paths — right from the homepage</li>
<li>Action-oriented labels to help you get the information you want faster</li>
<li> Design that works on mobile devices, like tablets and smartphones, so you can get information anytime, anywhere, and in the most convenient format for you</li>
</ul>
<p>The new Medicare.gov is just one of our efforts over the past year to make it easier for you to understand your Medicare. Whether it’s putting our information in <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/04/16/lets-be-clear-plain-writing-works/">simple, straightforward language</a> so you can understand it the first time you read it or <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/04/12/cutting-the-clutter-the-newly-designed-medicare-summary-notice/">improving the design of the “Medicare Summary Notice ”</a> so you can better understand your Medicare claims,  we’re committed to making Medicare information clearer and simpler.</p>
