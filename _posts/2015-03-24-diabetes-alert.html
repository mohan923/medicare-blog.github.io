<p>Diabetes affects millions of people – are you one of them? Tuesday, March 24 is American Diabetes Association Alert Day – a great time to take the <a href="http://www.diabetes.org/are-you-at-risk/diabetes-risk-test/">Diabetes Risk Test</a> to find out if you’re at risk for developing type 2 diabetes – a condition characterized by high blood glucose levels caused by either a lack of insulin or the body’s inability to use insulin efficiently. Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older adults.</p>
<p>Many people with diabetes don’t know that they have it, but <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-screenings.html">Medicare covers screening tests</a> so you can find out if you do.</p>
<p>If you have diabetes, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-supplies-and-services.html">Medicare covers many of your supplies</a>, including <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/insulin.html">insulin</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/blood-sugar-test-strips.html">test strips</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/blood-sugar-monitors.html">monitors</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/lancet-devices-and-lancets.html">lancets</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/glucose-control-solutions.html">control solutions</a>. In some cases, Medicare also covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/therapeutic-shoes-or-inserts.html">therapeutic shoes</a> if you have diabetic foot problems. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for these supplies.</p>
<p>Medicare also covers <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-self-mgmt-training.html">diabetes self-management training</a> to help you learn how to better manage your diabetes. You can learn how to monitor your blood sugar, control your diet, exercise, and manage your prescriptions. Talk to your doctor about how this training can help you stay healthy and avoid serious complications.</p>
