<p>Are you or a loved one hooked on tobacco? Join the millions who’ve found a good reason to give it up—tobacco use is the second leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for 1 in every 10 adult deaths.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to quit, we can help. Part B covers free counseling sessions as a preventive service to help you <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/smoking-cessation.aspx">quit smoking</a>—you pay nothing if your doctor accepts Medicare’s payment.</p>
<p>If you’ve already been diagnosed with an illness caused or made worse by tobacco use or you take a medicine affected by tobacco, you can continue to get up to 8 face-to-face counseling visits every 12 months. You pay your Part B deductible, and 20% of the Medicare-approved amount. If you get counseling in a hospital outpatient setting, you also pay the hospital a copayment.</p>
<p>Make May 31—World “No Tobacco” Day—your starting point to kick the habit. Visit the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/">Centers for Disease Control</a> and the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/tobacco/smoking">National Cancer Institute</a> to learn more about tobacco use and how you can overcome it.</p>
<p>Also, watch our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r52w97yTsuE&amp;list=UUhHTRPxz8awulGaTMh3SAkA&amp;index=6&amp;feature=plcp">video</a> about the World Health Organization’s World No Tobacco Day campaign and how Medicare supports it.</p>
