<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Mammograms are breast cancer screening tests that can often detect a lump before you or your doctor can feel it. This can help detect breast cancer early, when it’s the most treatable. All women over 40 should have a screening mammogram every 12 months – and </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/mammograms.html"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Medicare covers it at no cost</span></a><span style="font-family:Calibri;"> if your doctor accepts assignment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Talk to your doctor about risk factors, and to schedule your next screening. Take control of your health – better health is in your hands.</span></p>
