<p>It’s that time of year again. Protect yourself and the ones you love this flu season with your free flu shot.</p>
<p>Get your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/flu-shots.html">flu shot</a> early and stay healthy! Flu viruses change from year to year, so it’s important to get a flu shot each flu season. It’s free for people with Medicare, once per flu season in the fall or winter, when given by doctors or other health care providers (like senior centers and pharmacies) that take Medicare.</p>
<p>Schedule your flu shot today!</p>
