<ol>
<li>Guard your information.</li>
<li>Be wary of giveaways.</li>
<li>Don’t lend your identity.</li>
<li>If you spot something, say something.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are 4 simple ways to protect your identity and personal information from Medicare fraud, but they can be difficult to do if you’re caught off guard.</p>
<p>During Medicare Open Enrollment - between now and December 7 - you can expect to hear a lot about Medicare. You might be hearing a lot about the Health Insurance Marketplace this fall. That’s because the <b>Marketplace</b> Open Enrollment period overlaps with the <b>Medicare</b> Open Enrollment period.</p>
<p>The Marketplace is designed to help people who don’t have any health coverage. If you have health coverage through Medicare,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/medicare-and-the-marketplace.html"> the Marketplace won’t have any effect on your Medicare coverage</a>. In fact,<b> it’s against the law for someone who knows that you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan</b>.</p>
<p>Open Enrollment is a great time for you to review and compare your Medicare choices and make sure you have the coverage that fits your needs. Unfortunately, it’s also a popular time for Medicare fraud schemes.</p>
<p>Here are a few reminders to keep you safe from those who might not have your best interests in mind:</p>
<p><b>1.     </b><b>Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers – treat them like you’d treat your credit cards.</b></p>
<p>You’ll be hearing so much about Medicare during Open Enrollment, that it may not surprise you to get phone calls or visits to your house from people selling Medicare plans.</p>
<p>It’s illegal for someone to call and ask for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information.  A Medicare representative or a private insurance plan working with Medicare will <b>never</b> call and ask for this information, and we will <b>never</b> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.   And remember, it’s against the law for someone who knows that you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan.</p>
<p>2. <b>Be suspicious of people offering free medical equipment or services.</b></p>
<p>Anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number is tricking you – if it’s really free, they don’t need your Medicare number. It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!</p>
<p><b>3.     </b><b>Don’t let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare card or your personal information.</b></p>
<p>If someone asks you for your Medicare number, stop and think. If you wouldn’t feel comfortable giving that person your credit card number, <b>don’t</b> give them your Medicare number.</p>
<p>4. <b>Most importantly, if you suspect Medicare fraud, let us know!</b> Call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227).</p>

Remember, a little preparation goes a long way. If you experience a Medicare fraud scheme - walk away, hang up, close the door, or say “no thanks.”</p>
