<p>“To do” lists are very helpful during this hectic time of year. If something important isn’t written down, it’s easy to forget. If you still haven’t crossed off “Compare Medicare coverage” from your to do list, time is running out!</p>
<p>Medicare Open Enrollment ends this week on December 7. To help you sort through your choices, try using the <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a>. You can review the plan options in your area and decide the best mix of benefits and costs that meets your needs and budget.</p>
<p>In these last few days of Medicare Open Enrollment, take a moment to review your health care coverage and see if you need to make any changes for next year. If you decide you’re happy with the plan you have now, and the plan’s still being offered next year, you don’t need to do anything. But if you’re thinking about making any changes, now’s the time to act so you can cross another item off your to do list.</p>
