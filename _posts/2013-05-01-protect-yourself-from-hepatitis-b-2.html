<p>Did you know that 1.2 million people in the U.S. have chronic Hepatitis B, but many more people don’t know they’re infected because they have no symptoms? Hepatitis B is a contagious liver disease that can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious illness that can lead to liver disease or liver cancer.</p>
<p>Medicare can help keep you protected from Hepatitis B. The best way to prevent Hepatitis B is by getting the Hepatitis B vaccine, which is usually given as 3 shots over a 6-month period. You need to get all 3 shots for complete coverage. If you’re at high or medium risk for Hepatitis B, Medicare Part B will cover <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hepatitis-b-shots.html">Hepatitis B shots</a> for free.</p>
<p>Are you at risk for getting Hepatitis B? If you have hemophilia, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/glossary/e.html#esrd">End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)</a>, diabetes, or certain conditions that lower your resistance to infection, you have a higher risk for getting Hepatitis B increases.  Additionally, if you have a profession that puts you in frequent contact with blood or bodily fluids, you may be at a higher risk.</p>
<p>May is Hepatitis Awareness month. To find out more about preventing and treating Hepatitis B, visit the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/B/index.htm">Centers for Disease Control</a>.</p>
