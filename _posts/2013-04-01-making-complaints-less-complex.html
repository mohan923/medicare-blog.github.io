<p>We hope every healthcare experience you have is a positive one. That’s why we offer you a variety of tools to express your concerns. One of those tools is the ability to file a complaint (sometimes called a “grievance”).</p>
<p><b>Do you have a complaint?</b></p>
<p>If you have a concern or a problem that isn’t a request for coverage or reimbursement, you have the right to file a complaint. Not sure if you need to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/claims-and-appeals/index.html">file a complaint or an appeal</a>? Read some <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/claims-and-appeals/file-a-complaint/complaints.html">examples of situations</a> where you might need to file a complaint.</p>
<p><b>Things to know before you file a complaint:</b></p>
<p>Each plan has specific rules you’ll need to know and follow when filing a complaint.  If, after filing a complaint, your plan doesn’t address the issue, call 1-800-MEDICARE for assistance. You can also call your <a href="https://medicare.gov/Contacts/Default.aspx">State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP)</a> for free, personalized help filing a complaint.</p>
<p><b>Information you’ll need to have ready when you file a complaint:</b><b> </b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Basic information about you </span></b></p>
<ul>
<li>First and last name</li>
<li>Date of birth</li>
<li>State you live in</li>
<li>Zip code</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Preferred call back time, phone number, and response language</li>

<p><b>2 tools Medicare offers that can help…</b></p>
<p>1. A <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/manage-your-health/personal-health-records/personal-health-records.html">Personal Health Record</a> (PHR) is a record with information about your health that you, or someone helping you, can keep for easy reference using a computer. You control the health information in your PHR and can get to it anywhere, at any time, with Internet access.</p>
<p>2. The <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/manage-your-health/blue-button/medicare-blue-button.html">Blue Button</a> tool provides you an easy way to download your personal health information to a file. You can download the file of your personal data and save the file on your own personal computer.  You can access the Blue Button through your account on <a href="https://www.mymedicare.gov/">MyMedicare.gov</a>.</p>
