<p>Family caregivers provide an average of 20 hours of care per week – when you’re the caregiver, that can make it hard for you to care for yourself.</p>
<p>November is National Family Caregiver Month – a perfect opportunity to reach out for help if you’re caring for someone with Medicare. If you’re a caregiver, here are 4 things you can do this month to help <strong>you</strong> help your loved one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check out our <a href="http://medicare.gov/campaigns/caregiver/caregiver.html">caregiver resources. </a></li>
<li>Make sure your loved one’s Medicare coverage still meets their needs. Medicare Open Enrollment is from now until December 7, and it’s important to take a few minutes to <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2014/10/15/medicare-open-enrollment-are-you-ready-to-pick-a-plan/">review coverage and pick a plan that works for your loved one</a>.</li>
<li>Find resources near you by visiting the Administration on Aging’s <a href="http://www.eldercare.gov/">Eldercare Locator</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This month is also a perfect opportunity to make sure you are getting the care you need for yourself. If you or someone you’re caring for is uninsured, <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov">learn more about the Health Insurance Marketplace</a>.</p>
