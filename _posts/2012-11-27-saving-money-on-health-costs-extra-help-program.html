<p><span style="color:#000000;">If you’ve ever found yourself skipping a day of your medication or cutting your pills in half to make your supply last a little longer, there’s help. Medicare has a special program called “</span><a href="http://medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/save-on-drug-costs/save-on-drug-costs.html"><span style="color:#800080;">Extra Help</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">.” If you have limited income and resources you can sign up to get help paying things like </span><span style="color:#000000;">monthly premiums, annual deductibles, and prescription copayments in your Medicare drug plan. Did you know that the Extra Help program is estimated to be worth about $4,000 dollars per person, per year? Even if you’re not sure you’d qualify, it’s worth filling out an application to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Estimates show that about 2 million people </span><span style="color:#000000;">with Medicare may be eligible for the Extra Help program but don’t even know it. Are you or a family member one of these people?</span></p>
