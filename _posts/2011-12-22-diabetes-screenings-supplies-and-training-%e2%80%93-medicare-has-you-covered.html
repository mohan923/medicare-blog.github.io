<p>Diabetes affects millions of people – are you one of them? <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/diabetes-screening.aspx">Medicare covers supplies and self-management training</a> to help you manage your diabetes. Many people with diabetes don’t know that they have it – and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/diabetes-screening.aspx">Medicare covers screening tests</a> so you can find out if you do.</p>
<p>If you’re at high risk for developing diabetes, Medicare covers up to two fasting blood glucose (blood sugar) tests each year. If your doctor accepts <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/Glossary/a.html">assignment</a>, you pay nothing for this test. You may be at high risk for diabetes if you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, or a family history of diabetes. Talk to your doctor to find out when you should get your free screening test.</p>
<p>If you have diabetes, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/home.asp">Medicare covers many of your supplies</a>, including test strips, monitors, and control solutions. In some cases, Medicare also covers therapeutic shoes if you have diabetic foot problems. You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for these supplies.</p>
<p>Medicare also covers diabetes self-management training to help you learn how to better manage your diabetes. You can learn how to monitor your blood sugar, control your diet, exercise, and manage your prescriptions. Talk to your doctor about how this training can help you stay healthy and avoid serious complications.</p>
<p>Take control of your health – talk to your doctor today about screening tests and what supplies and training you may need for your health.</p>
