<p>Do you have diabetes, a family history of glaucoma, or are you African American and age 50 or older? If so, your risk of getting glaucoma may be higher. With the start of a new year, it’s the perfect time to schedule a regular eye exam to check for glaucoma. You can prevent vision loss by finding and treating problems early.  <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/glaucoma-tests.aspx">Find out more about Medicare’s glaucoma screening coverage.</a></p>
