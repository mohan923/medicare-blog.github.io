<p>Mammograms are breast cancer screening tests that can detect a lump before you or your doctor can feel it. This helps to detect breast cancer early, when it’s most treatable. All women over 40 should have a mammogram every 12 months – and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/mammograms.html">Medicare covers it at no cost</a> if your doctor accepts assignment. Talk to your doctor about risk factors and to schedule your next screening.</p>
<p>October is Breast Cancer Awareness month, so let’s spread the word on the fight against breast cancer.</p>
