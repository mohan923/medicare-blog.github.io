<p>It feels like “to do” lists are everywhere these days – on a pad of paper on the kitchen table, in email, or in an app on a smart phone.  If you still have “Review Medicare coverage” on your to do list, time is running out!</p>
<p>Medicare Open Enrollment ends this week on December 7. To help you sort through your choices, try using the <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Medicare Plan Finder</a>. You can review the plan options in your area and decide the best mix of benefits and costs that meets your needs and budget.</p>
<p>Remember, the <b>Marketplace</b> Open Enrollment period overlaps with the <b>Medicare</b> Open Enrollment period. The Marketplace is designed to help people who don’t have any health coverage. If you have health coverage through Medicare,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/medicare-and-the-marketplace.html"> the Marketplace won’t have any effect on your Medicare coverage</a>.</p>
<p>In these last few days of Medicare Open Enrollment, take a second to review your options.  If you like your current health care coverage, you don’t need to do anything. But if you’re thinking about making any changes, now’s the time to act and cross another item off your to do list.</p>
