<p>Do you have a minute to keep your heart and kidneys healthy?  Getting a fast (less than a minute) and simple test can tell you if your blood pressure is too high.  High blood pressure usually has no signs or symptoms, but it can lead to a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure.  Medicare helps make checking your blood pressure easy because it’s covered in your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/people-like-me/new-to-medicare/welcome-to-medicare-visit.html">“Welcome to Medicare”</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">Yearly Wellness </a> visits at no cost to you.</p>
<p>If you have high blood pressure, you can control it with lifestyle changes and medicine.  You may be at risk for high blood pressure if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smoke</li>
<li>Eat salty foods</li>
<li>Don’t exercise enough</li>
<li>Drink more than a moderate amount of alcohol</li>
<li>Have a family history of high blood pressure</li>
<li>Are overweight</li>
</ul>
<p>May is National High Blood Pressure Awareness Month, so get tested and keep your heart and kidneys healthy!</p>
