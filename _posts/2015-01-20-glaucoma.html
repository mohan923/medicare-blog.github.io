<p>Do you have diabetes or a family history of glaucoma? Are you African American and 50 or older, or are you Hispanic American and 65 or older? If so, your risk of getting glaucoma may be higher, but don’t worry – Medicare covers a glaucoma test once every 12 months for people at high risk for glaucoma.</p>
<p>January is National Glaucoma Awareness Month. Find out more about Medicare’s <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/glaucoma-tests.html">glaucoma screening coverage</a>. Also, visit the <a href="http://www.preventblindness.org/">Prevent Blindness</a> website to see how you can join the ongoing fight against vision loss.</p>
