<p>It’s picking season – pumpkins, apples, Halloween candy…and a Medicare health or drug plan. Today is the start of Medicare Open Enrollment!</p>
<p>Picking a plan is an important and personal decision. Now’s the time to think about what matters to you, and pick the Medicare plan that meets your needs. Here are some things to think about:</p>
<p><b>Does the plan cover the services you need? </b></p>
<p>Future health care needs can be hard to predict, but changes happen. Make sure you understand what services and benefits you’re likely to use in the coming year and find coverage that meets your needs. If you have other types of health or prescription drug coverage, make sure you understand <a href="http://medicare.gov/supplement-other-insurance/how-medicare-works-with-other-insurance/how-medicare-works-with-other-insurance.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">how that coverage works with Medicare</span></a>. And, if you travel a lot, does your plan cover you when you’re away from home?</p>
<p>No matter what plan you pick, you’ll have better choices and more benefits thanks to the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/affordable-care-act.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Affordable Care Act</span></a> like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>A discount of more than <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">50% on covered brand-name drugs</span></a> if you hit the Part D prescription drug coverage gap (“donut hole”)</li>
<li>A free <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">yearly “wellness” visit</span></a>, so you can sit down with your doctor and talk about your health concerns and the best ways to stay healthy</li>
<li>A host of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">preventive tests and screenings</span></a> — including cancer screenings —  most at no cost to you</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What’s the cost? </b></p>
<p>The lowest-cost health plan option might not be the best choice for you – consider things like the cost of premiums and deductibles, how much you pay for hospital stays and doctor visits, and whether it’s important for you to have expenses balanced throughout the year.</p>
<p><b>How about convenience? </b></p>
<p>Your time is valuable. Where are the doctors’ offices? What are their hours? Which pharmacies can you use? Can you get prescriptions by mail? Do the doctors use <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-health-records/electronic-health-records.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">electronic health records</span></a> or <a href="http://medicare.gov/manage-your-health/electronic-prescribing/electronic-prescribing.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">prescribe electronically</span></a>? Remember that even if you’re happy with your current plan, these answers might change from year to year.</p>
<p>Not all health care is created equal, and the doctors, hospitals and facilities you choose can impact your health. Open Enrollment is also a good time to ask yourself whether you’re truly satisfied with your medical care. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan">Look for plans</a> with a 5‑star performance rating — the right expertise and care can make a difference. The <a href="https://medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Medicare Plan Finder</span></a> makes it easy to compare plans so you can pick a plan that meets your needs.</p>
