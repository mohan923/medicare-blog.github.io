<p>Medicare Offers Information and Support to Caregivers.</p>
<p>More than 66 million Americans care for loved ones who have a chronic illness, disability, or frailties that come naturally with old age. Nobody is in a better position than family caregivers to help loved ones manage their health care when it comes to medicines, treatments, diets, and exercise.</p>
