<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;">Although popular love songs might tell you otherwise, a broken heart can’t kill you – but </span><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/"><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:Arial;">heart disease</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"> can.  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">You might not be able to avoid Cupid’s arrow, but you can take steps to lower your risks and prevent heart disease.  Start by scheduling an appointment with your doctor to discuss whether you’re at risk for heart disease.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;">Medicare will cover a </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cardiovascular-disease-screenings.html"><span style="font-family:Arial;">cardiovascular screening</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"> at no cost to you every 5 years.  The screening includes tests to help detect heart disease early and measures cholesterol, blood fat (lipids), and triglyceride levels.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="color:#000000;">If you and your doctor discover that you’re at risk for a heart attack or stroke, there are steps you can take to help prevent these conditions.  You might be able to make lifestyle changes (like changing your diet and increasing your activity level or exercising more often) to lower your cholesterol and stay healthy. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;">Luckily, you don’t have to face these challenges alone. The national </span><a href="http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/"><span style="font-family:Arial;">Million Hearts</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"> campaign</span> <span style="font-family:Arial;">has pledged to help prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. You can join them, and get information and resources you need to learn how to take care of your heart and live a healthy life.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">February is </span><a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">American Heart Month</span></a><span style="color:#000000;">, and a healthy heart is the best Valentine’s Day gift you could ever give yourself, or the people who love you.</span></p>
