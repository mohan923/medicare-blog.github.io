<p>It’s the New Year, which means it’s time for those annual resolutions, whether it’s eating right or tackling a new skill.  But none may be more important than making the resolution to get heart healthy in 2013.</p>
<p>Did you know heart attacks and strokes are the first and fourth leading cause of death in the U.S.? The <a href="http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/">Million Hearts™ initiative</a>, launched in 2012, is aiming to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. CMS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working with other federal agencies, communities, health systems, non-profit organizations and private-sector partners to help educate Americans on how to make a long-lasting impact against cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>If you’re at risk for, or are already suffering from, heart disease, now’s the time to practice the “Million Hearts ABCS”:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>A</b>spirin for people at risk</li>
<li><b>B</b>lood pressure control</li>
<li><b>C</b>holesterol management and</li>
<li><b>S</b>moking cessation</li>
</ul>
<p>Medicare can help you take control of many of the major risk factors for heart disease. People with Medicare can get <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cardiovascular-disease-screenings.html">cardiovascular screenings</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/smoking-and-tobacco-use-cessation.html">counseling to stop smoking</a>, and blood pressure and weight checks during their <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly wellness visit</a> with their doctor.</p>
<p>Make a New Year’s resolution and give your loved ones one more gift they’ll be sure to treasure—a healthier you in 2013. Help prevent a heart attack or stroke by <a href="http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/be_one_mh.html">joining the Million Hearts</a>™ initiative.</p>
