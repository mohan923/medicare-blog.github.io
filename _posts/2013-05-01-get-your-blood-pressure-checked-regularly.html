<p>Do you or does someone you know have high blood pressure? Most likely, your answer is yes. More than one-third of adults in the United States have high blood pressure, and many don’t even know it. High blood pressure increases your risk of heart disease, the #1 killer worldwide, and many other diseases. That’s why it’s important to get your blood pressure checked regularly.</p>
<p>Medicare helps make checking your blood pressure easy. A blood pressure screening is covered in your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/people-like-me/new-to-medicare/welcome-to-medicare-visit.html">“Welcome to Medicare” visit</a> and your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">Yearly Wellness visit</a> at no cost to you.</p>
<p>There are also many ways to prevent and help treat high blood pressure. Eating a healthy diet and avoiding sodium are easy ways to lower blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight and being physically active are also important. The surgeon general recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week. You can also check your blood pressure between your yearly visits for free at many pharmacies, senior centers, and health fairs.</p>
<p>May is National High Blood Pressure Education Month, watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opQFBVd7oHI">our video</a> to learn more.</p>
