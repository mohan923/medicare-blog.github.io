<p>Have you had your mammogram this year?</p>
<p>Mammograms are breast cancer screening tests that can often detect a lump before you or your doctor can feel it. This can help detect breast cancer early, when it’s the most treatable. All women over 40 should have a screening mammogram every 12 months – and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/mammograms.html"><span style="color:#800080;">Medicare covers it at no cost</span></a> if your doctor accepts assignment.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about risk factors, and to schedule your next screening. Take control of your health – better health is in your hands.</p>
