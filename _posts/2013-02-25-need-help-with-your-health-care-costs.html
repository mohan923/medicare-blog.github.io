<p>Susan, a woman in her mid-80’s, went to her local SHIP for help with her finances and healthcare decisions. Susan hasn't had prescription drug coverage since 2011, and she currently isn’t getting any help to pay her prescription drug costs. Susan spoke with a SHIP counselor about her situation and learned she could get Extra Help with paying her prescription drug costs. Susan's now enrolled in a plan where she can afford her medications.</p>
<p>If you have limited income and resources, like Susan, you may be eligible for “Extra Help” or one of Medicare’s savings programs. These programs may help you save on premiums, deductibles, copayments, or prescription costs.</p>
