<p>The Medicare Summary Notice has a new look to help you better understand your Medicare information. We’re excited to announce that you will soon start to see the award-winning, redesigned <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/help-and-resources/mail-about-medicare/medicare-summary-notice.html">Medicare Summary Notice (MSN)</a> hitting your mailboxes.  The new design puts clear language in an easy-to-follow format, so that your Medicare information is easier to understand.</p>
<p>As part of our “Your Medicare Information: Clearer, Simpler, At Your Fingertips” initiative, we <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/04/12/cutting-the-clutter-the-newly-designed-medicare-summary-notice/">listened to you</a> and made the MSN better with:</p>
<ul>
<li>An easy-to-understand snapshot that puts the information you care about most (like deductible status, a list of provider visits, and claim status) in one convenient place.</li>
<li>A dedicated section that tells you how to spot potential <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/03/12/join-the-fight-against-medicare-fraud-2/">fraud</a>.</li>
<li>Clearer language, descriptions and definitions.</li>
<li>Larger type that makes the MSN easier to read.</li>
<li>Preventive services information to help you stay healthy.</li>
<li>A clearer description of the appeal process to follow if you disagree with a claim.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have Original Medicare, you can expect this new design for the MSN to arrive in your mailbox throughout the next few months. Or, better yet, go to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">MyMedicare.gov</span>, where you can check your Medicare claims information online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.</p>
