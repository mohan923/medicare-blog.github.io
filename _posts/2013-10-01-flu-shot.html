<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">It’s that time of year again.  With the beginning of fall comes the beginning of flu season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Get your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/flu-shots.html">flu shot</a> early and stay healthy!  It’s free for people with Medicare, once per flu season in the fall or winter, when given by doctors or other health care providers (such as senior centers and pharmacies) that take Medicare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Schedule your flu shot today!</span></p>
