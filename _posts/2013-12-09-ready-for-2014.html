<p>The new year is fast approaching. Here are a few things to ask yourself to make sure you’re ready for 2014.</p>
<p><b>1. Do you have the right insurance card to use when you go to the doctor in 2014?</b><br />
If you changed your health or drug plan during Medicare Open Enrollment and don’t get your new card or welcome packet by January 1<sup>st</sup>, contact your plan for help. If you need to fill a prescription right away, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/coverage/filling-prescription-without-card/fill-prescriptions-without-card.html">find out how to fill a prescription without your card</a>.</p>
<p>If you changed from a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) back to Original Medicare, use your red, white, and blue Medicare card when you go to the doctor. <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/medicarecard/">Get a new card if you lost or damaged yours, or need to update your information</a>.</p>
<p><b style="line-height:1.5;">2. Did you budget for next year’s Medicare Part B deductible?</b></p>
<p>Don’t forget, if you have Medicare Part B and are in Original Medicare, you’ll have to meet your deductible before your Medicare coverage pays for services and supplies. Next year, the Medicare Part B deductible will be $147, the same as it was in 2013. Make sure to plan your health care budget to account for the increased cost of doctor visits for the time that it will take to cover your deductible. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/costs-at-a-glance/costs-at-glance.html">Find out more about Medicare costs in 2014.</a></p>
<p><b style="line-height:1.5;">3. Have you made appointments to get any preventive tests or screenings?</b></p>
<p>Medicare covers many <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive services</a> to keep you healthy and screenings to check for health problems. Many of these services are covered each year at no cost to you. Ask your doctor when you should schedule your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">wellness visit</a> and other screenings. You can also use <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">MyMedicare.gov</a> to track your visits and make a calendar of preventive services.</p>
<p>Talk to your doctor about these covered preventive services to find out what’s right for your health needs.</p>
<p><b style="line-height:1.5;">4. Does your drug or health plan meet your needs?</b></p>
<p>If not, Medicare has a way for you to get the coverage you want instead of having to wait for the next Open Enrollment. At any time during the year, you can switch to a Medicare Advantage Plan or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan that has a 5-star rating.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5;">Plan ratings are based on member surveys, information from doctors and health care providers, and other sources. The plan ratings are scores that show the quality and performance of the plan, on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 being the highest rated plans.</span></p>
<p>You can make this change once per calendar year. <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">Find 5-star health and drug plans in your area</a>.</p>
