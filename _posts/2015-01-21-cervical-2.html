<p>Did you know all women are at risk for cervical cancer, and it occurs most often in women over 30? Fortunately, Medicare covers 2 types of screening test – the Pap smear and human papilloma virus (HPV) test – that can help find cancer and other health problems early and improve recovery and survival rates.</p>
<p>January is Cervical Health Awareness Month. Watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBtnj3N3IMs">Cervical Health Awareness Month video</a> and visit our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cervical-vaginal-cancer-screenings.html">cervical &amp; vaginal cancer screenings</a> page to learn what these tests do and how often they’re covered.</p>
<p>Also, visit the <a href="http://www.nccc-online.org/">National Cervical Cancer Coalition</a> website to find ways you can raise awareness about cervical cancer and how you can make a difference.</p>
