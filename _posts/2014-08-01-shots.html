<p>Are you taking precautions to make sure you stay healthy?  Just like you take your car for scheduled maintenance, it’s important to do what you can to take care of your body.  Medicare covers many <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive services</a>, and we make it easy for you to get these 3 shots:</p>
<ol>
<li><a title="Click here to view Flu Shots" href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/flu-shots.html"><b>Flu Shots</b></a>—Covered once a flu season in the fall or winter.<b> </b></li>
<li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hepatitis-b-shots.html"><b>Hepatitis B Shots</b></a><b>—</b>Covered for people at high or medium risk for Hepatitis B (usually a series of 3 shots).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/pneumococcal-shots.html"><b>Pneumococcal Shot</b></a><b>—</b>Covered to help prevent pneumococcal infections (like certain types of pneumonia). Most people only need this shot once in their lifetime.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we approach the fall, you’ll see these shots offered in many places, such as your local pharmacy, so make sure you take advantage of them. You pay nothing as long as the supplier or doctor accepts assignment for giving the shot.</p>
<p>A strong immune system is way more important than your car, so make the time to stay healthy and take a few minutes to watch our video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncDOTyjryWo">National Immunization Awareness Month</a>.</p>
