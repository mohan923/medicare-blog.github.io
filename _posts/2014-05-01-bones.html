<p>Will a silent disease shatter your life?  Every year, a growing number of Americans are finding out that they have osteoporosis-a disease that causes bones to weaken and be more likely to break.  Medicare <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html">can help</a> you prevent or detect osteoporosis at an early stage, when treatment works best.  Learn the facts so you can protect your bones!</p>
<p>Many people believe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Osteoporosis is a natural part of aging that only affects older women</li>
<li>Bone loss can’t be treated once it starts</li>
<li>The only risk of osteoporosis is broken bones from falls</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these myths are true.  What is true is:</p>
<ul>
<li>While 1 in 3 women over 50 will develop osteoporosis, 1 in 5 men will, too</li>
<li>It is possible to make bones stronger</li>
<li>Around 25 % of people die within the first 6 to 12 months after a hip fracture</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, there are many ways to prevent or lessen the severity of osteoporosis.  Making sure you get enough calcium, vitamin D, and exercise are 3 important ways to make your bones stronger.  May is National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month.  Talk to your doctor about getting a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html">bone mass measurement</a>—it may be free.</p>
