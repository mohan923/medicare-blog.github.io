<p>Going through the process of buying a new computer or tablet takes a bit of elbow grease, but when the salesman throws in free accessories and tech support, it’s worth it. Not only are the free accessories fun, but there’s a peace of mind knowing that the support you’ll need is free.</p>
<p>Extra benefits and peace of mind can be a big plus in health coverage, too.</p>
<p>You might be hearing a lot about the Health Insurance Marketplace this fall. That’s because the <b>Marketplace</b> Open Enrollment period overlaps with the <b>Medicare</b> Open Enrollment period. The Marketplace is designed to help people who don’t have any health coverage. If you have health coverage through Medicare,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/medicare-and-the-marketplace.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;"> the<span style="font-family:Calibri;"> </span>Marketplace<span style="font-family:Calibri;"> </span>won’t have any effect on your Medicare<span style="font-family:Calibri;"> </span>coverage</span></a>.</p>
<p>If you have Medicare, you’re not affected by the Marketplace, but you still get to enjoy extra benefits thanks to the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/affordable-care-act.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Affordable Care Act</span></a> like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>A discount of more than <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">50% on covered brand-name drugs</span></a> if you hit the Part D prescription drug coverage gap (“donut hole”)</li>
<li>A host of <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">preventive tests and screenings</span></a> — including cancer screenings —  most at no cost to you</li>
</ul>
<p>Medicare also covers a <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">yearly wellness exam</span></a> each year. This is a great chance to sit down with your doctor and take the time to talk about your needs — and address small health concerns before they become big ones. You can keep track of your preventive services and get reminders for them at <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">MyMedicare.gov</span></a>.</p>
<p>Also, most people with Medicare have access to Medicare Advantage Plans, and many of these plans offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn’t cover like vision, hearing, dental coverage, prescription drugs, or extended coverage when you travel.</p>
<p>Just like deciding between a desktop, laptop, or tablet computer, only you know what extra benefits and services are most important for you and your family.</p>
<p>During Medicare Open Enrollment, decide what benefits are most important in helping you meet your unique health care needs. Use the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Medicare Plan Finder</span></a> to look at all of the health and drug plan options in your area.</p>
