<p>If you’ve ever found yourself skipping a day of your medication or cutting your pills in half to make your supply last a little longer, there’s help. Medicare has a special program called “<a href="http://medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/save-on-drug-costs/save-on-drug-costs.html">Extra Help</a>.” If you have limited income and resources you can sign up to get help paying things like monthly premiums, annual deductibles, and prescription copayments in your Medicare drug plan.  Even if you’re not sure you’d qualify, it’s worth filling out an application to see.</p>
<p>Many people with Medicare may be eligible for the Extra Help program but don’t even know it. Are you or a family member one of them?</p>
<p>It’s easy and free to apply for Extra Help. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/extrahelp">online</a>.</li>
<li>Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213. TTY users should call 1‑800‑325‑0778.</li>
<li>Apply at your <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/apps6z/FOLO/fo001.jsp">local Social Security office</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t wait - apply today to see if you qualify for some extra help with your health costs.</p>
