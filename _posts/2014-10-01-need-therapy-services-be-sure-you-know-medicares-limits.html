<p>Are you getting physical therapy after a hip replacement? Speech-language pathology services after a stroke? Anytime you get outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech-language pathology services, be sure you know the limits for how much Medicare will pay.</p>
<p>Medicare helps pay for medically-necessary outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services. There are limits, called “therapy caps,” on these services when you get them from most outpatient providers.</p>
<p>The therapy cap limits for 2014 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,920 for physical therapy (PT) and speech-language pathology (SLP) services combined</li>
<li>$1,920 for occupational therapy (OT) services</li>
</ul>
<p>You may qualify to get an exception so that Medicare will continue to pay its share for your services after you reach the therapy cap limits.</p>
<p>October is National Physical Therapy Month – take the time to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/pt-and-ot-and-speech-language-pathology.html">learn more</a> about Medicare’s limits on therapy services.</p>
