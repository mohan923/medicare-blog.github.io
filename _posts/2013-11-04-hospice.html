<p>November 2013 marks the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Medicare coverage for Hospice care. That’s right, for 30 years Medicare has covered hospice care, so that those who are terminally ill can spend the last moments of their lives with dignity and comfort, among their loved ones.</p>
<p>Hospice is a program of care and support for people who are terminally ill. The focus is on comfort and support, not on curing an illness. Hospice care is generally provided in the home, by a specially trained team of professionals and caregivers. Services may include physical care, counseling, drugs, equipment, and supplies for the terminal illness and related condition(s).</p>
<p>For more information about hospice, you can visit Medicare.gov. To find a hospice program, talk to your doctor or call your <a href="http://medicare.gov/contacts/">state hospice organization</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s to 30 more years of providing the comfort, care, and support that you and your family deserve during this difficult time.</p>
