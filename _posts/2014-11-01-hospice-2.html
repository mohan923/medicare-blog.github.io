<p>Choosing to stop curative treatment is a scary moment for anyone. You worry about your family, the quality of the care you’ll receive, and keeping your dignity.</p>
<p>For over 30 years Medicare has covered hospice care, so that those who are terminally ill can spend the last moments of their lives with dignity and comfort, among their loved ones. The focus is on comfort and support, not on curing an illness.</p>
<p>Deciding you need Hospice care is a difficult choice to make, and it’s important to be informed about what Hospice covers. Here are a few of the services Hospice provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Care is generally provided in the home.</li>
<li>A specially trained team of professionals and caregivers provide care for the “whole person,” including your physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs.</li>
<li>Services typically include physical care, counseling, drugs, equipment, and supplies for the terminal illness and related conditions.</li>
<li>Family caregivers can get support.</li>
<li>Once you choose hospice care, your hospice benefit should cover everything you need.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about hospice, you can visit Medicare.gov. To find a hospice program, talk to your doctor or call your state hospice organization.</p>
<p>When you need us, we’ll be here.</p>
