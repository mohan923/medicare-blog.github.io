<p>When you’re busy with work and family, it’s hard to find time to schedule health appointments. To make it easy, you can get these free tests at AARP/Walgreens’ new “Wellness Tour” buses without making an appointment. And, as long as you’re 18 or older, you can get these tests even if you don’t have health insurance:<br />
<br />
• Total Cholesterol Levels<br />
• Blood Pressure<br />
• Bone Density<br />
• Glucose Levels<br />
• Waist Circumference<br />
• Body Mass Index</p>
<p><strong>Find a “Wellness Tour” Stop Near You</strong></p>
<p>There’s no advance paperwork to fill out - all you have to do to get these free tests is show up. You’ll be able to find "Wellness Tour" buses at community centers, Walgreens stores and other locations in <a href="http://www.aarpwalgreens.com/tour">more than 3,000 cities across the country</a>, including Puerto Rico.</p>
<p><strong>Get Your Test Results Instantly</strong></p>
<p>After your tests, you’ll get your results instantly. Certified health screeners will walk you through each test and explain your results, so you can make sure you walk away informed. You can share your results with your doctor, so you can work together to decide what other tests, medications or lifestyle changes you may need to stay healthy.</p>
<p><strong>Talk With Someone from Medicare </strong></p>
<p>On <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/welcometomedicare/landing.html">select dates </a>of the Wellness Tour, you’ll be able to talk with someone from Medicare who can personally answer your questions. If you have Medicare, remember that you can now get even more <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/preventive-service-overview.aspx">preventive services </a>at little or no cost to you, including the “Welcome to Medicare” preventive visit.</p>
<p>We all know that schedules are tight, but what’s more important than your health? These free tests are important and an easy way to make sure you stay as healthy as possible. So, catch the bus for your first stop on the road to wellness.</p>
