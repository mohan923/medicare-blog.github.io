<p>Did you ever put off doing a task or getting a test and later wished you’d just gotten it over with? If you’re a man with Medicare, now’s the time to talk with your doctor about whether you should get screened for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/prostate-cancer-screening.aspx">prostate cancer</a>, for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/colorectal-cancer-screenings.html">colorectal cancer</a>, or for both. Screening tests can find cancer early, when treatment works best.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about the cost—if you’re a man 50 or over, Medicare covers a digital rectal exam and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test once every 12 month. Also, Medicare covers a variety of colorectal cancer screenings, and you pay nothing for most tests.</p>
<p>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, second only to lung cancer in the number of cancer deaths. Not sure you should get screened? You’re at a higher risk for getting prostate cancer if you’re a man 50 or older, are African-American, or have a father, brother, or son who has had prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Colorectal cancer is also common among men—in fact, it’s the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States among cancers that affect both men <i>and</i> women. If everyone 50 or older got screened regularly, we could avoid as many as 60% of deaths from this cancer.</p>
<p>In most cases, colorectal cancer develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Fortunately, screening tests can find these polyps, so you can get them removed before they turn into cancer. If you’re 50 or older, or have a personal or family history of colorectal issues, make sure you get screened regularly for colorectal cancer.</p>
<p>June is Men’s Health Month, a perfect time for you (and the men in your life) to take the steps to live a safer, healthier life. Watch our videos on how Medicare has you covered on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcM0wptOIJg">prostate cancer</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HPJp3VYdfg">colorectal cancer</a> screenings, and visit the Centers for Disease Control for more information on <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Features/HealthyMen/">men’s health</a>.</p>
