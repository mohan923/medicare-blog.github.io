<p>As the days get shorter and the nights get cooler, you can expect to hear more about Medicare. That’s because October 15 – December 7 is Medicare Open Enrollment, and it’s your chance to review your health care coverage and see if you need to make any changes, or if you’re happy sticking with the plan you have.</p>
<p>This year, you may hear a lot about the Health Insurance Marketplace. The <b>Marketplace</b> Open Enrollment period (October 1, 2013–March 31, 2014) overlaps with the <b>Medicare</b> Open Enrollment period (October 15–December 7, 2013). The Marketplace is designed to help people who don’t have any health coverage. If you have health coverage through Medicare,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-act/medicare-and-the-marketplace.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;"> the<span style="font-family:Calibri;"> </span>Marketplace<span style="font-family:Calibri;"> </span>won’t have any effect on your Medicare<span style="font-family:Calibri;"> </span>coverage</span></a>.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, look around – you’ll find a wealth of information about your Medicare benefits, especially in these everyday places:</p>
<p><b>1. In the mail</b></p>
<p>Look through your mail carefully — you may get important notices from your current plan, Medicare, or Social Security about changes to your coverage or any <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/help-paying-costs/save-on-drug-costs/save-on-drug-costs.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">extra help</span></a> you may get paying for prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Also look for your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/medicare-and-you/medicare-and-you.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Medicare &amp; You</span></a> handbook. Like an old friend, it shows up around the same time every year. If you decided to “<a href="https://www.medicare.gov/gopaperless/home.aspx"><span style="color:#0000ff;">go paperless</span></a>,”<span style="color:#000000;"> you’ll get an email pointing you to </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/"><span style="color:#0000ff;">medicare.gov</span></a><span style="color:#000000;"> where you can get all the same information.</span></p>
<p>You’ll also start to see brochures from companies that offer Medicare health and drug plans. Just remember,<a href="http://www.medicare.gov/forms-help-and-resources/report-fraud-and-abuse/prevent-fraud/tips-to-prevent-fraud.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;"> be smart about protecting your personal information and your identity</span></a> — plans aren’t allowed to call or come to your home without an invitation from you. And, it’s against the law for someone who knows that you have Medicare to sell you a Marketplace plan.</p>
<p><b>2.     </b><b>On your computer </b></p>
<p>Comparing your plan choices is important. Our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Medicare Plan Finder</span></a> is ready with all of the 2014 cost information to make it as easy as possible. Enter the drugs you take to find out how you can lower your costs, review the plan’s <span style="color:#000000;">ratings</span> to compare plan quality, and join a plan right online if you find one that meets your needs. If you haven’t used the Plan Finder before, check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SCvgSZURBA#t=34"><span style="color:#0000ff;">video</span></a> to help you get started.</p>
<p><b>3.     </b><b>In newspapers, magazines, TV and radio</b></p>
<p>Take a moment as you enjoy these crisp mornings to tune into the Medicare information that’s out there. You may find a local event — somewhere right around the corner with counselors to help you, like your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/contacts"><span style="color:#0000ff;">State Health Insurance Assistance Program</span></a>. Don’t miss the chance to get personalized help if you need it!</p>
<p>Now’s the time to enjoy the choice and control you have over your health care coverage. Just like fall, Medicare Open Enrollment only comes once a year.</p>
