Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older adults. <span style="color:#000000;">Many people with diabetes don’t know that they have it, but </span><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-screenings.html">Medicare covers screening tests</a><span style="color:#000000;"> so you can find out if you do.  </span></span></span></p>
