<p>If you’re planning a vacation abroad this summer, you already know that there’s a lot to do before you leave. There are suitcases to pack, an itinerary to plan, and perhaps a passport to renew. We want you to have the most relaxing vacation possible, so before you go don’t forget to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look into Medicare coverage outside the United States.</li>
<li>Think about getting additional health care coverage.</li>
</ol>
<p>You already have Medicare, so your health care services and supplies are covered when you’re in the U.S., (including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands). When you travel overseas or outside the U.S. (including to Canada or Mexico), it’s important to know how your Medicare works.</p>
<p>In most cases, Medicare <strong>won’t</strong> pay for health care services or supplies you get outside the U.S. Medicare may pay for health care and services you get outside the U.S. <a href="http://medicare.gov/coverage/travel-need-health-care-outside-us.html">in these rare cases</a>.</p>
<p>Because Medicare coverage outside the U.S. is limited, you may want to buy a travel insurance policy. To find out more about these policies, talk to an insurance or travel agent. Not all travel policies include health insurance, so ask questions and read the terms and conditions carefully.</p>
<p>Taking the time to plan out your health care coverage before you travel abroad will help you to have an enjoyable and relaxing trip. For more information on how to stay healthy abroad, visit the Centers for Disease Control’s <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/">Traveler’s Health page</a>.</p>
