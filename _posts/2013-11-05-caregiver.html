<p>Did you know that  over 66 million Americans care for loved ones who have chronic illnesses, disabilities, or frailties that come naturally with old age?</p>
<p>November is National Family Caregiver Month – a perfect opportunity to reach out for help if you’re caring for someone with Medicare. If you’re a caregiver, here are 4 things you can do this month to help <b>you</b> help your loved one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check out our <a href="http://medicare.gov/campaigns/caregiver/caregiver.html">caregiver resources, </a>including our <a href="http://medicare.gov/campaigns/caregiver/caregiver-resource-kit.html">caregiver resource kit</a>  and tips on how to <a href="http://medicare.gov/files/ask-medicare-tips-for-caregivers-care-for-yourself.pdf">take care of yourself</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure your loved one’s Medicare coverage still meets their needs. Medicare Open Enrollment is from now until December 7, and it’s important to take a few minutes to <a href="http://blog.medicare.gov/2013/10/15/time-to-pick-a-plan/">review coverage and pick a plan that works for your loved one</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Learn how to reach out for help with AARP’s article on “<a href="http://www.aarp.org/relationships/caregiving-resource-center/info-12-2011/set-up-caregiving-team.html">Creating Your Caregiving Team</a>” - a great reminder that caregiving is a big responsibility that no one should take on alone.</li>
