<p>Medicare fraud affects everyone. You can team up with Medicare to help.</p>
<p>Our Senior Medicare Patrol volunteers are teaching people like you how to spot, report, and stop fraud, and protect themselves from identity theft. </p>
<p>Here are some things you can do:</p>
<p>•	Guard your Medicare and Social Security numbers. <strong>Treat them like you would treat your credit cards</strong>. </p>
<p>•	Hang up the phone if someone calls and asks for your Medicare number, Social Security number, or bank or credit card information. We will <strong>NEVER</strong> call and ask for this information, and we will <strong>NEVER</strong> call you or come to your home uninvited to sell Medicare products.</p>
<p>•	Be suspicious of anyone who offers you free medical equipment or services and then requests your Medicare number. <strong>It’s illegal, and it’s not worth it!</strong> </p>
<p>•	Do not let anyone borrow or pay you to use your Medicare ID card or your identity.</p>
<p>•	Check your Medicare claims for errors. Look at your Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) or statements from your Medicare plan. You can also check <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">www.MyMedicare.gov </a>or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) as soon as your claims have been processed. The sooner you see and report errors, the sooner we can stop fraud.</p>
<p>•	Call 1-800-MEDICARE to report any suspected fraud. TTY users should call<br />
1-877-486-2048.</p>
<p>Medicare is cracking down on fraud, and so can you. </p>
